\end{center}

\section*{Set-up}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The classroom is divided into 2 economies. 
    One economy operates with \textbf{WHITE} currency, the other uses \textbf{PINK} currency. 
    \item Two desks/tables, one for each economy that represents the "shops"
    \item Two tables drawn on the board: \textbf{Distributions} and \textbf{Open Market Exchange Record}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Roles}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There are 2 students assigned to each shop.
    These \textbf{"Shopkeepers"} will periodically distribute the contents of the packets with each team getting an equal portion of the available currency
    \item Students form 8 teams within their respective economies and as evenly as possible (max: 5 students)
    \item Subject to the \textbf{Trading Rules} below, each team can decide when and how to spend their currency to purchase goods
    \item The instructor will keep time and is the ultimate authority on all matters
\end{itemize}

\section*{Activities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As seen in the \textbf{Distributions} table, there will be six \textbf{buying/selling} rounds
    \item At the beginning of each round, the \textbf{Shopkeepers} will open their packets and record the contents in the \textbf{Distributions} table.
    They then distribute equal amounts of currency to the teams in their respective economies.
    When the instructor indicates, the \textbf{Shopkeepers} then oversee the sale of goods available at their stores - subject to the \textbf{Trading Rules}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Trading Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item General Rule: Teams from one economy can always sell their goods on a \textbf{cash-only basis (no barter)} to teams in the other economy for prices they negotiate for themselves.
    As these happen, they \textbf{MUST BE RECORDED} on the \textbf{Open Market Exchange Record} table
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Round 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Teams can buy goods only from their own economy's stores at the set price
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Round 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any team is free to access either shop, so long as they have the \textbf{appropriate currency}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Round 3 - 6: RULES TO BE ANNOUNCED}
