## Activity 01

### Game Set-Up

There are **10 groups (countries)** made up of 8 members each

In this game, we are seeing how **technological differences** across countries can impact outcomes.
Each country is tasked with producing as much as they possibly can given the time and resource constraints.

Each country is given an envelope with resources to produce paper shapes. 
Each shape has its own value and are "sold" in the market for a wealth transfer. 

**Shapes must adhere to specific measurements and the edges must be cut with scissors.**
**Any shape that is not measured properly or have a scissor-cut edge will be discarded.**

<!--
There are **three different type of countries** with the following **endowments**:
