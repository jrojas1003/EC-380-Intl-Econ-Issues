## Activity 01

### Game Set-Up

There are **10 groups (countries)** made up of 8 members each

In this game, we are seeing how **technological differences** across countries can impact outcomes.
Each country is tasked with producing as much as they possibly can given the time and resource constraints.

Each country is given an envelope with resources to produce paper shapes. 
Each shape has its own value and are "sold" in the market for a wealth transfer. 

**Shapes must adhere to specific measurements and the edges must be cut with scissors.**
**Any shape that is not measured properly or have a scissor-cut edge will be discarded.**

**YOUR SHAPES MUST HAVE YOUR COUNTRY NUMBER ON IT**


There are **three different type of countries** with the following **endowments**:

| **Total** | **2** | **38**     | **21**   | **1** | **50** | **23900** | **100%** |

There were a total of **112** shapes that met the necessary criteria. 

From the original raw resources and the total $5000 in cash, all countries produced a total of **$23900** in welfare (goods + money).

24 total cutouts were rejected: 9 rectangles, 4 circles, 11 triangles. 
This totals **$8000** in lost wealth. 

### Observations

The easiest shape to produce was the **triangle** followed by a **rectangle**.
It makes sense that countires specialized in producing these shapes due to the available technology. 
The one nation that was able to produce **circles** was likely the only nation that had a compass. 
This makes sense given that the most common technology were rulers. 

Unsurprisingly, wealth was concentrated in a few countries. 
This can be primarily explained through the initial endowment of technology. 
Some of the middle-income countries were able to trade and produce in a surprising way, closely matching wealthy nations. 

The data also suggests that poor countries either gave up, or were not able to trade for the necessary tools. 

Rather than trading goods, which everyone was aware of the international market price, countries traded their resources (paper) and techonology (tools). 
Something that actually happens in the real world is the trade of intermediate goods, which are input factors necessary in production.
