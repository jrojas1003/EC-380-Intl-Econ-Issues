    "text": "Activity 01\n\nGame Set-Up\nThere are 10 groups (countries) made up of 8 members each\nIn this game, we are seeing how technological differences across countries can impact outcomes. Each country is tasked with producing as much as they possibly can given the time and resource constraints.\nEach country is given an envelope with resources to produce paper shapes. Each shape has its own value and are “sold” in the market for a wealth transfer.\nShapes must adhere to specific measurements and the edges must be cut with scissors. Any shape that is not measured properly or have a scissor-cut edge will be discarded.\nYOUR SHAPES MUST HAVE YOUR COUNTRY NUMBER ON IT\nThere are three different type of countries with the following endowments:\n\n\nHigh Income (2)\n\nx2 Scissors\nx2 Rulers\nx2 Protractors\nx2 Pencils\nx5 White Paper\nx5 $100 Notes\n\n\nMiddle Income (5)\n\nx1 Rulers\nx2 Pencils\nx5 White Paper\nx5 $100 Notes\n\n\nLow Income (3)\n\nx2 Pencils\nx5 White Paper\nx5 $100 Notes\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCircles\nRectangles\nTriangle\nHalf\nCash Bills\nWealth\nShare\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n5\n0\n1\n13\n4000\n16.74%\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n400\n1.67%\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n500\n2.09%\n\n\n4\n0\n8\n8\n0\n5\n5300\n22.18%\n\n\n5\n0\n15\n0\n0\n0\n4500\n18.83%\n\n\n6\n0\n10\n0\n0\n8\n3800\n15.90%\n\n\n7\n0\n0\n13\n0\n0\n3900\n16.32%\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n500\n2.09%\n\n\n9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n500\n2.09%\n\n\n10\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n500\n2.09%\n\n\nTotal\n2\n38\n21\n1\n50\n23900\n100%\n\n\n\nThere were a total of 112 shapes that met the necessary criteria.\nFrom the original raw resources and the total $5000 in cash, all countries produced a total of $23900 in welfare (goods + money).\n24 total cutouts were rejected: 9 rectangles, 4 circles, 11 triangles. This totals $8000 in lost wealth.\n\n\nObservations\nThe easiest shape to produce was the triangle followed by a rectangle. It makes sense that countires specialized in producing these shapes due to the available technology. The one nation that was able to produce circles was likely the only nation that had a compass. This makes sense given that the most common technology were rulers.\nUnsurprisingly, wealth was concentrated in a few countries. This can be primarily explained through the initial endowment of technology. Some of the middle-income countries were able to trade and produce in a surprising way, closely matching wealthy nations.\nThe data also suggests that poor countries either gave up, or were not able to trade for the necessary tools.\nRather than trading goods, which everyone was aware of the international market price, countries traded their resources (paper) and techonology (tools). Something that actually happens in the real world is the trade of intermediate goods, which are input factors necessary in production."

This can be achieved through subsidizing local industry, taxing imports, and limiting number of goods that can enter the country, per annum\nTariff: Percentage of value based tax on a country’s imports. These vary based on the origin and commodity of imported goods\nQuota: Weight and quantity limits on the amount of goods that can be imported into the country\n\n\n\nNot all quotas are acts of protectionism. Some are required for national security (e.g. protecting the domestic supply of food), or to avoid health concerns related to imoprts from specific countries (e.g. livestock diseases)"
