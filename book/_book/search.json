I do not expect us to become experts in the field in just 10 weeks.\nThe goal is to give you enough knowledge that you can spot the bullshit when you read the news, listen to a podcast, or talk with someone. The goal is to make you comfortable with talking about the complexity of international economics.\nIdeally, by the end of the course you will have:\n\nUnderstood what comparative advantage means for international trade\nUnderstood why countries specialize and trade\nUnderstood why trade is generally good, and understand how it can be bad\n\n\n\nInternational Market Game\nWhat better way to learn than to play a game?\nThroughout the term we will create our own international economy. The objective is to experience what markets do and how different agents make decisions. The theory will teach us what should happen, but theory is just theory.\nWe will test theory and learn by doing."
