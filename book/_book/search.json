    "text": "Course Objectives\nThis is a companion book I’ve written for my EC 380 International Trade course. EC 380 is an introductory course to international economics undergraduates. I do not expect us to become experts in the field in just 10 weeks.\nThe goal is to give you enough knowledge that you can spot the bullshit when you read the news, listen to a podcast, or talk with someone. The goal is to make you comfortable with talking about the complexity of international economics.\nIdeally, by the end of the course you will have:\n\nUnderstood what comparative advantage means for international trade\nUnderstood why countries specialize and trade\nUnderstood why trade is generally good, and understand how it can be bad\n\n\n\nInternational Market Game\nWhat better way to learn than to play a game?\nThroughout the term we will create our own international economy. The objective is to experience what markets do and how different agents make decisions. The theory will teach us what should happen, but theory is just theory.\nWe will test theory and learn by doing."

Each country is tasked with producing as much as they possibly can with the given materials in a set amount of time.\nEach country is given a different envelope with materials to produce paper shapes. Each paper shape has it’s own value and are “sold” to the instructor for wealth. Shapes must follow specific measurements and be cut using scissors. Any shape that is not to the proper specifications or well-cut are discarded.\nDue to the difference in endowments some countries are “more productive” than others.\nThere are three different type of countries with the following endowments:\n\n\nHigh Income (2)\n\nx2 Scissors\nx2 Rulers\nx1 Circle (Plate)\nx2 Pencils\nx10 White Papers\nx5 $100 Notes\n\n\nMiddle Income (5)\n\nx2 Rulers\nx2 Pencils\nx10 White Papers\nx5 $100 Notes\n\n\nLow Income (3)\n\nx2 Pencils\nx10 White Papers\nx5 $100 Notes"

Of those 218, there were 12 circles (valued at $500 each), 36 rectangles (valued at $300 each), and 170 equilateral triangles (values at $150 each).\nFrom the original raw resources and total $5000 handed out, all countries produced a total of $47300 in welfare (goods + money).\n\nNotes\nUnsurprisingly, wealth is concentrated in a few nations (most likely the original High-Income countries).\nAnd, because of the incentives, there was a specialization in the smallest and easiest-to-produce shape (equilateral triangles).\nThe data suggests that the poor countries either gave up, or only managed to produce the minimum given their constraints.\nTrade, in this context, was around the trading of techonology (rich nations “rented” out their scissors) rather than trade of goods.
