\begin{questions}

\question
Answer the following short questions

\begin{parts}
    \part[4] In your own words, how would you define \textbf{Labor Abundance} in the Heckscher-Ohlin model setting?
    \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
    \part[4] How does the capital-labor ratio help us determine patterns of trade?
    \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
    \part[4] Describe the key difference(s) that separate the HO model from the Ricardian model

\question
Suppose we are considering an \textbf{HO Model setting}, where countries have not yet opened up to trade.
Two goods are produced: \textbf{Suits and Ozempic}. 
Suppose that tailoring \textbf{Suits} is \textbf{labor-intensive} in production as it is primarily done by hand and making \textbf{Ozempic} is \textbf{capital-intensive} in production as it requires exact and automated machinery. 
The countries, Country A and Country B, have the following \textbf{Labor (L) and Capital (K)} endowments.

\input{tables/Q2-table}

\begin{parts}
    \part[4] What are the \textbf{Capital-Labor Ratios} for each country?
    \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
    \part[4] Which country has comparative advantage in producing Ozempic?
    \vspace*{\stretch{1}} 
    \part[4] How will trade flows look once each country specializes?
    \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
\end{parts}

\newpage 

\question[8]
How do trade outcomes play out for owners of factor inputs when trade opens? 
Address both capital and labor outcome when a country is abundant in either capital or labor.
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}

\question[6]
Consider the \textbf{Specific-Factor Model}. 
What are the implications for domestic labor income of switching from autarky to open trade, when a given country is \textbf{land-abundant}?
Is this impact different if the country is \textbf{capital-abundant} instead?
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}

\newpage 

\question[8]
Recall the \textbf{Magnification Effect} we learned in lecture.
Let the capital share be 27\% and the labor share be 73\% to produce Banana Bread.
If the rental rate of capital were to remain constant, then a 12\% increase in the price of Banana Bread must be accompanied by what percentage increase/decrease in wages?
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}

\question[4]
We covered ambiguities of changes in labor outcomes, given greater openness to trade. 
Who does \textbf{Autor et al (2013)} suggest are the most vulnerable with respect to labor market outcomes in the US, following Chinese trade liberalization between 1990 and 2007?
