## Economic Trends

Manufacturing has been on a [long downward trend in NA and West EU]{.hp} for decades

Wage inequality increased, particularly in the US with a primary effect on young, low-education, and less-skilled workers

Throughout this period, [trade saw its greatest bout of liberalization]{.hp} due to:

::: {.incremental}
- Widespread tariff reductions
- Ascensions of major economies such as China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and;
- Reductions in direct trade costs (Advancement in technology)

## Economic Trends

With the economy experiencing these long trends of declining manufacturing employment and wage reductions questions come up

::: {.fragment}
- Where are these jobs going?
- Are low wages abroad influencing wage levels in developed economies?
:::

::: {.fragment}
The [number of jobs]{.hp} depends on age profile, size of population, labor market policies, and the state of the business cycle

While trade does not act as the main influence of [jobs level]{.hp} for large open economies, it [might affect specific sectors]{.hi-red} in a particularly focused manner

## Trade & Employment

- Trade with less developed countries has potentially led to spillover effects on local wage rates

::: {.incremental}
- Up until recently, decline in low-skill wage rates was only somewhat attributed to increased trade openness

- It was initially suggested that [tech improvements were driving the marginal productivity of skilled labor upward]{.h}, driving up the wage gap

- Since 2000, this gap has stagnated, leaving experts without a main explanatory factor anymore

## Trade & Employment

Research in this area has seen a resurgence given that previously accepted reasoning on it has become outdated

A natural question that comes up is [whether trade or technology]{.hp} plays a larger role in sector-specific outcomes

::: {.fragment}
- I think this question is too broad and not entirely helpful to counteract the issue

- It may also redirect much needed attention from research that addresses how to [facilitate reallocation among displaced manufacturing workers]{.hp}
