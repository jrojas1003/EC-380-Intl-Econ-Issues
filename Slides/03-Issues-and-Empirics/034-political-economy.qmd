## Political Economy of Trade

There are many points of view of how international trade should be treated through a political view

Up until now we have seen there are both good and bad outcomes of trade, happening at the exact same time

Take for example the following scenario:

::: {.incremental}
- In the US, workers in the import-competing sectors earn wages substantially below the average wage, and those workers earning the lowest wage face the highest risk of separation from their current employer due to import competition
:::

---

## Political Economy: Possible Outcomes 

We have workers in import-competing sectors earning lower wages than average and facing a higher risk of unemployment

Let's take the example of production workers in the apparel sector in 2019 where wages were below 25% the average wage for all production workers

We could have:

::: {.incremental}
- There may be widespread sympathy for the situation these workers are going through and, consequently, restrictions on apparel imports
- If this happens, gains from more affluent consumers that would have happened with more imports do not realize.

## Political Economy: Trade is Good?

## Electoral Competition

Let me introduce some political science concepts to motivate possible political shifts due to trade 

Suppose the following:

::: {.incremental}
- There are two competing parties that are willing to promise whatever will enable each to win the next election
- Policy can be described along one dimension 
    - Something simple like a tariff rate level
- Voters differ in the policies they prefer

## Electoral Competition - Example

Let's think of a simple example:

Imagine a country that [exports skill-intensive goods]{.h} and [imports labor-intensive goods]{.hi}. 
Political parties are divided alongside the level of tariff rate to impose

::: {.fragment}
There are two type of voters:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[High-skill voters]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- Prefer [low tariff rates]{.hi-green}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Low-skill voters]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- Prefer [high tariff rates]{.hi-red}

## What Policy to Choose?

If we think about lining up all the voters in the order of the tariff rate they prefer, with the voters who favor the lowest rate on the left and those who favor the highest rate on the right we get:

## Median Voter

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/median-voter-01.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .small}
Parties will converge on the tariff rate preferred by the [median voter]{.h}

To see why, think what happens if one party takes the position of tariff $t_{A}$

::: {.fragment}
The other party could propose a slightly lower rate $t_{B}$, which is preferred by almost all other voters. 

It is always in their interest to undercut any tariff proposal that is higher than what the median voter wants

## Median Voter and Trade {.smaller}

Interestingly enough, the [median voter model]{.h} does not seem to work well for trade policy

According to this model, a policy should be chosen based on how many voters it pleases:

::: {.fragment}
- A policy that inflicts large losses on a few people but benefits a large number of people should be a political winner

- A policy that inflicts widespread losses but helps a small group should be a loser
:::

::: {.fragment}
However, this is not usually the case:

- Usually, voters consider protectionist trade policy which will benefit only a few while harming a majority

    - Think of the US diary industry which is protected through an elaborate system of tariffs and quotas
    - These restrictions make dairy products slightly more expensive for consumers while benefiting an industry which employs about 0.1% of the workforce
