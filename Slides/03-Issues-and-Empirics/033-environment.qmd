## Environmental Effects

::: {.incremental}
- International transportation is a small fraction of [overall emissions]{.hp} but a surprisingly large fraction of [trade-related emissions]{.hp}
- 2/3 of trade-related emissions in US exports are due to international transportation
- Many exporters and products that look relatively "clean", when focusing on output emissions, are in fact [heavy emitters]{.hp} once we include transportation
- Under [trade liberalization]{.hp}, transport emissions will become increasingly important, growing [twice as fast]{.hp} as the emission from trade-related output

## Environmental Effects

[Main Findings]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Shows international trade harms the environment
- Effects are equally driven by production and transportation of traded goods
- [Welfare gains]{.hp} of trade are greater than environmental costs by a factor of 161
- [Welfare gains]{.hp} across every country in the sample, [however gains are disproportionately poorer for less-developed countries]{.h}
