## FX Market: Medium Run

Consider it to be typically a 4 to 5 year range, where countries experience ebbs and flows of [business cycle]{.hp} booms and busts

::: {.fragment}
Consider the US economy going through a [business cycle boom]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- During boom periods, incomes go up, [aggregate demand of goods/services rises]{.hp} across consumers

- A part of that will lead to [increased demand for imports]{.hp}

- This implies a greater need for foreign currency (to purchase imports)
:::

## FX Market: Medium Run

[US incomes increase]{.hp}, demand for UK imports increases, so [demand for GBP]{.hi} increases

## FX Market: Short Run

The [Short-Run]{.h} will look relatively more chaotic

We will consider the [Short-Run]{.h} to be a time period of one year or less

::: {.fragment}
We observe continuous day-to-day fluctuations in exchange rates

## FX Market: Short Run

[So what causes short-run changes in Exchange Rates?]{.hp}

::: {.incremental}
- Interest rate adjustments, which can occur 4-5 times in a year
- Speculation, driven by exogenous shocks to the state of the economy
    - Political scandals
    - Discovery of natural gas deposits 
    - COVID outbreak
:::

::: {.fragment}
The latter contributes to a mechanism known as [price discovery]{.hp} in exchange rates
:::

## FX Market: Short Run

> [Price Discovery]{.hp} is the trial-and-error process of discovering the [equilibrium price in a market]{.hp}
>
> If speculators believe a currency is overvalued, they sell that currency, driving its value down

::: {.incremental}
- If [correct]{.hi-green}, currency moves towards an equilibrium and speculators are rewarded through arbitrage profits

- If [wrong]{.hi-red}, large losses are realized.
This can often lead to bankruptcy if these risks were taken based on borrowed funds
