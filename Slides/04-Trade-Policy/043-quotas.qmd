## Quota Analysis

[Quotas]{.hp} limit the quantity of good imports rather than adjust the price

The net results are the same:

::: {.fragment}
- Less imports
- Fall in total domestic consumption
- Rise in domestic production

However there is a significant difference from [tariffs]{.hp}
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
[No tariff revenue for the government]{.hp} $\Rightarrow$ Greater loss in economic welfare

## Quotas

[Type of Quotas]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- [Limitations:]{.hi} Specifies in terms of quantities product is counted in 
    - For example, number of cows, kg of ore

- [Licensing Requirement:]{.hi} Forces importers to gain government approval with respect to importing a specific type of good. By regulating the number of licenses available, the government can place an obstacle on import volumes

- [Voluntary Export Restraint (VER):]{.hi} Exporting country voluntarily agrees to limit exports for some period. This is usually a compromise made to avoid more extreme measures being levied by the importer country

## How Do Quotas Work?

Let a country enter free-trade and experience world price equal to $P_{w}$

::: {.column width="40%" .small}
- Suppose the government sets a quota on imports of quantity $Q_{2}^{*} - Q_{1}$ 

[At $\;\; P_{w}$]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- [Domestic production is $Q_{1}$]{.h}
- [Domestic demand is $Q_{2}$]{.h}
- [Imports]{.hi} are $Q_{2} - Q_{1}$ 
- [Prices]{.hi} will rise until the market can clear

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/market-quota-02.png){fig-align="left" height="500"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .small}
- The [Domestic Price]{.h} settles at $P_{q}$
- [Domestic Supply]{.h} grows to $Q_{1}^{*}$
- The main difference is that the area $c$ is not captured by the government

[Difference from Tariffs]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Area $c$ captured by foreign producers that earn extra profits 
- [Domestic Producers]{.h} prefer quotas over tariffs as a form of industry protection
