## Inputs & Outputs

While tariffs protect one industry,they may also [inconvenience other domestic industries]{.h} that are reliant on inputs of intermediated goods

::: {.fragment}
- US tariffs on steel products protected the steel industry and hurt the automotive industry
:::

::: {.fragment}
Let's introduce two concepts:
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Nominal Rate of Protection]{.hp}: 
The amount of a [tariff expressed as a percentage of a good's price]{.hi}.
This is the tariff we have discussed so far
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Effective Rate of Protection]{.hp}: 
The level of protection on intermediate inputs and nominal tariff levied on the protected good.
[Measured as percentage change in domestic value added]{.h} after tariffs on intermediate and final goods are applied
:::

## Inputs & Outputs

I mentioned [value added]{.hp}, so let's define that too

::: {.fragment}
[Value-Added]{.hp}: 
Contribution of domestic production factors (capital and labor) to a given product/good

With that defined, we can take a deeper look at [Effective Rate of Protection]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    \text{Effective Rate of Protection} = \dfrac{(VA^{*} - VA)}{VA}
$$

- $VA$ is [domestic value-added]{.hi} under free-trade

- $VA^{*}$ is $VA$ [after accounting for all relevant tariffs]{.hi}

## Effective Rate of Protection

Suppose we introduce [two tariffs]{.hp}, in sequence

## Effective Rate of Protection: Final

## Inputs & Outputs

It is possible to go too far trying to protect domestic industries and end up hurting them

Sufficiently high import reliance can make tariff protection yield [negative protection measures]{.hp}, depending on the good examined

## Summary

<br><br>

- Tariffs are bad for countries with little influence on world prices

- Large countries exhibit an ambiguous effect, conditional on everyone playing nice

- Tariff protection can backfire, depending on input reliances
