## Tariff Analysis

So far we have examined transitions from [autarky]{.hp} into [free trade]{.hp} 

::: {.fragment}
In practice, even the most seemingly open economies will have some kind of measures in place that regulate the manner in which goods are traded internationally
:::

::: {.fragment}
Take something that seems like a good cause: [quality control]{.h}

Restrictions introduce [quality control]{.hp} over goods entering the country but have the added effects of [limiting volume of trade]{.hp} that would otherwise occur

[Why?]{.hi .align-center}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Trade policy, like any other form of interverntion, introduces [costs for firms]{.hp}, which get passed on to consumers. 
Some consumers will [switch to domestic goods]{.hp}
:::

## Tariff Analysis

To understand how tariffs may affect outcomes, we have to understand the components and start from the beginning 

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- [Consumer Demand Curve]{.hi}
- [Producer Supply Curve]{.hi}
- [Consumer and Producer Surplus]{.hi .align-center}
:::

---

## Consumer Demand Curve

- Demand is mapped by the [marginal wilingness of individuals to pay]{.h} for a good at a given price

::: {.incremental}
- At a particularly high price, only a small number of individuals would purchase
- [As price falls]{.hp}, the good enters into a greater pool of individuals' marginal willingness to pay, leading to [quantity demanded rising]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Therefore, we assume a [negative relationship]{.hi-red} between market price and [quantity demanded]{.h}
:::

--- 

## Producer Supply Curve

- When the market price is particularly low, only a small number of firms can afford to service the market

::: {.fragment}
- As [prices rise]{.hp}, the [quantity supplied to the market increases]{.hp}, given that the greater associated revenue makes business profitable for an increasing number of firms
:::

::: {.fragment}
Therefore, we assume a [positive relationship]{.hi-green} between market price and [quantity supplied]{.h}
:::

---

## Consumer and Producer Surplus

When we combine these two strands of intuition we arrive at:

::: {.incremental}
- Demand curve for a given good is [downward sloping]{.hi-red}
- Supply curve for a given good is [upward sloping]{.hi-green}
:::

::: {.fragment}
As per standard economic theory, the market will produce where supply meets demand
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Any difference between [marginal willingness to pay]{.h} and [price]{.h} represents [surplus for the consumer]{.h}

- Any difference between [marginal willingness to receive]{.hi} and [price]{.hi} represents [surplus for the producer]{.hi}

## Consumer and Producer Surplus: Calculation

In order to quantify welfare, we need to know the size of these areas. Thankfully, we will work with triangles which have a simple formula

::: {.fragment}
To calculate the area of [consumer surplus]{.hp}

$$
    CS = \dfrac{1}{2} \times [\text{Demand}(q = 0) - p^{*}] \times q_{d}^{*}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
To calculate the area of [producer surplus]{.hp}

$$
    PS = \dfrac{1}{2} \times [p^{*} - \text{Supply}(q = 0) ] \times q_{s}^{*}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
Where $p^{*}$ and $q^{*}$ are simply the equilibrium price and quantity, respectively
:::

---

## Consumer and Producer Surplus

These triangles are useful and help us understand the market:

::: {.fragment}
- Help us discuss implications of [tariffs]{.hp} and [quotas]{.hp}

- CS and PS are determined by market prices and quantities
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
The question remains: [How do tariffs influence P and Q?]{.hp}

::: {.incremental}
- Our demand and supply curves will reflect national production capacities

- Equilibrium price is determiend by world price

## Introduce World Trade

::: {.column width="30%"}
$$
    P^{W} < P^{*}

Local supply is at $Q_{1}$ below market market demand $Q_{2}$

::: {.fragment}
Import amount is 
$$
    Q_{2} - Q_{1}
$$
:::

## Introduce World Trade

![](images/market-trade-02.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.incremental .tiny}
- Market experiences a huge increase in [CS]{.h} due to trade
- [PS]{.h} falls, but [net welfare rises (CS + PS)]{.hp}
- Assume it is a small country $\Rightarrow$ the scale of demand cannot affect [world price]{.hp}
:::

## Imposing a Tariff 

A tariff will upset this balance

<br><br>

::: {.fragment}
Let the country's government impose a tariff in the amount of $t$, per good imported

Price will update to $P^{t} = P^{W} + t$, all of the outcome variables we measured are affected

## Tariff Analysis {.small}

![](images/market-tariff-03.png){fig-align="center" width="900" height="400"}

Consumers lost $a + b + c + d$, others gained $a$ and $c$

There is a [societal net loss]{.hp} of $b + d$ where $d$ is [deadweight loss]{.hp} and $b$ is [efficiency loss]{.hp}

---

## Deadweight Loss

[Deadweight Loss]{.hp}

> Loss associated with the economic welfare consumers that otherwise would have purchased in this market would have generated, had there been no government interference

<br>

$$
    d = \dfrac{1}{2} \Delta P \times \Delta Q_{2}, \; \text{where } Q_{2} \text{ represents quantity demanded}
$$

---

##  Efficiency Loss

[Efficiency Loss]{.hp}

> Loss associated with producing additional goods at an excessive cost, relative to how much it would have cost the rest of the world to generate these goods

<br>

$$
    b = \dfrac{1}{2} \Delta P \times \Delta Q_{1}, \; \text{where } Q_{1} \text{ represents quantity supplied}
$$

## Tariff Analysis Caveats

These equilibria we have seen do not take into account:

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Retaliatory tariffs (e.g. China Trade War)
- Innovation and productivity (less competition)
- Import/Export interdependencies within countries
- Rent seeking behavior (lobbying)
:::

---

## Tariff Analysis: Large Country 

It is possible to improve natinoal welfare with tariffs as long as there is no retaliation

<br> 

::: {.incremental}
- Tariff adjustment triggers price reduction by exporter country (Rest of World)
- Fall in [Home country demand]{.h} lowers $P_{W}$ to $P_{W}^{*}$.
Home price becomes $P^{*}_{t} = P_{W}^{*} + t$
- Price reduction offsets some of the deadweight loss caused by tariff introduction
