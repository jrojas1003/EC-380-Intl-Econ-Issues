## Interdependence

The Current, Capital, and Financial Accounts are [interdependent]{.hp}

::: {.fragment}
The [Current and Capital Accounts]{.hp} measure the flows of goods, services, and transfers between a country and the rest of the world
:::

::: {.fragment}
The [Financial Account]{.hp} measures the net flows of asset purchases and sales
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Since each element in the [Current Account]{.hp} must include a financial transaction:

- [Current plus Capital Account must equal the Financial Account]{.hi}
:::

---

## Interdependence of Accounts {.smaller}

A [negative Current Account plus Capital Account]{.hp} means the home country is spending more than it is earning from abroad, leading to a [need for external financing]{.hp}

- This [net borrowing]{.hp} shows up in the [Financial Account]{.hi}, which tracks the flow of financial capital in and out of the country

::: {.fragment}
[Example: US in 2019]{.h}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- [Net Acquisition of Financial Assets (lent abroad)]{.hi}: $427 bn
- [Net Incurrence of Liabilities (borrowed from foreigners)]{.hi}: $784 bn
- [Net Change in Derivatives]{.hi}: -$38 bn
:::

[Balance on the Financial Account]{.hp .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Financial Account } &= \text{Net Acq. of Assets } - \text{Net Inc. of Liabilities} + \text{Net Change in Derivatives} \\
    \text{Financial Account } &= 427 - 784 + (-38) = -395 \text{ billion}
\end{align*}

## Statistical Discrepancy

[Why is Current + Capital $\; \neq \;$ Financial?]{.hp .align-center}

## Statistical Discrepancy

[Why is Current + Capital $\; \neq \;$ Financial?]{.hp .align-center}

It is impossible to record all transactions and ensure that they are accurately measured

::: {.fragment}
The amound of net lending or borrowing on the current and capital accounts rarely matches the amount implied by the financial account balance

The [Statistical Discrepancy]{.hp} is the [size of the measurement error]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
While the Current and Financial Accounts are mirror images of each other, [a large share of a nation's gross financial account transactions is not in response to the current account of flows of goods, services, or income]{.hi}
:::

## Discrepancy Example

Suppose a London-based company buys stock in a Chilean firm, and lends money to the government of Thailand

[Note:]{.h .note} This has [nothing to do with the movements of goods and services]{.h}. These are purely financial transactions and must have a [net value of zero]{.hi}. 

::: {.fragment}
[Net value of zero]{.hi} is because [the purchase of an asset is simultaneously the sale of an asset of equal value]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
- If a Canadian citizen [buys shares in the Mexican stock market (capital outflow)]{.h}, they [must sell Canadian dollars or some other asset (capital inflow)]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
As a result, the [financial account]{.hp} is a complete picture of [net flows]{.h} of financial assets during the year

## Financial Risks

[Certain types of financial flows introduce instability/risk]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- Some financial flows are very mobile, representing short-run tendencies

- Financial flows are often vehicles for transmitting a financial crisis from one country to another
:::

::: {.fragment}
The degree of mobility of financial flows and the potential of some flows to introduce a large element of volatility into an economy have turned the type of flows that a country receives into a major issue
