## Financial Account Basics

Assets include bank accounts, stocks and bonds, real property such as factories, businesses, real estate, and monetary gold and foreign currencies

::: {.fragment}
[Positive Net Acquisition of Financial Assets]{.hp} implies residents buying [more]{.hi} foreign assets than they are selling
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Positive Net Incurrence of Liabilities]{.hp} means foreigners purchasing [more]{.hi} of home country's assets than they are selling
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Financial Derivatives]{.hp} are assets with a value that is derived from the value of some other asset

- Such as commodity prices or exchange rates, or one of many other possibilities
:::

## Financial Account: Derivatives {.small}

Essentially packaged as [financial options]{.hp} (puts/calls) that allow for hedging against risk

::: {.fragment}
For example, farmers used them to protect against fluctuations in agricultural prices
:::

::: {.fragment}
> Wheat farmers might sign a contract in March to sell their crop in September at a price agreed when the contract is signed.
:::

::: {.fragment}
> The value of the contract depends on the fluctuation in wheat prices.
:::

::: {.fragment}
> If prices [go above the agreed price]{.h}, the contract becomes more valuable to the buyer because they have a guaranteed lower price, and vice-versa if prices fall over the summer
:::

::: {.fragment}
[The contract is a derivative since its value depends on the price of wheat]{.hp .align-center}

## Financial Account

Presents the flow of assets during the year and not the stock of assets that have accumulated over time

::: {.fragment}
All flows are ["net" changes]{.hp} rather than "gross" changes
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Net changes are the [differences between assets sold and assets bought]{.hi}, as when US residents purchase shares in the Mexican stock market while simultaneously selling Mexican bonds

- Net change in US-owned assets is [difference between the value of the shares purchased and the bonds sold]{.hi}

- If the stocks and bonds are equal in value, then the net change is zero

## Financial Account

Payments abroad to buy financial assets are a [credit]{.h}

Payments received from abroad for selling home country assets [(net inccurrence of liabilities)]{.hp} are a [debit]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
[Debits]{.h} are viewed as the [inflow received when assets are sold to foreigners]{.hp}

[Credits]{.h} are the [payment outflow when financial assets are purchased by home country residents]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Conceptually similar to the credits and debits of exports and imports
