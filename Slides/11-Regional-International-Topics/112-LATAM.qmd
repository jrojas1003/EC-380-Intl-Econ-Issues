## Context

The region is extraordinarily diverse and shouldn't be thought of as a "one size fits all"

But there are common themes shared by ***nearly*** all nations:

::: {.incremental}
- Common history: 
    - Spanish/Portuguese colonization and common language
    - Gained national independence from Spain and Portugal during the same period
- During the first wave of globalization many countries participated in the world economy as exporters of agricultural and mineral commodities
- After the Great Depression, many nations shifted to interior planning and a targeted industrial strategy
:::

## Context

::: {.align-center}
This strategy of [state-led industrialization]{.hp} to encourage more domestic manufacturing came to be known as [import substitution industrialization]{.hp}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- In the 70s, most nations became [borrowers]{.hi} and suffered through a prolonged debt crisis in the 80s
- That triggered plenty of economic policy reforms which mirrored the transformation seen in Europe after the collapse of communism
- At the turn of the century, some nations have become impatient and have turned back toward more state interventionist policies

## Context

For the first part of the [twentieth century]{.hi} Latin America was one of the fastest-growing regions of the wrold. 

The region's real GDP per capita grew as fast or faster than Euroupe, the US or Asia

::: {.fragment}
After World Ward II, most countries in the region experienced good growth rates, and the two largest countries, Brazil and Mexico, had incredible increases in their per capita income levels
:::

::: {.fragment}
As the 1970s came, the world economic growth slowed and the LATAM experience became more varied.

Some countries grew faster, and some grew slower. 
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[But nearly all relied more heavily on government expenditures to stimulate growth]{.hp}
:::

---

## Context

This period became undone by the [Latin American Debt Crisis (1982-1989)]{.hp}

The [Debt Crisis]{.hp} turned the 80s into a [Lost Decade]{.hi} where sovereign debt issues grew worse by negative growth, banking crises, currency crises, and hyperinflation.

As a response, nations shifted away from state-led economic development toward more market-oriented policies

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[One of the most important part of this occured in the realm of trade, where countries adopted a strategy known as Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)]{.hp}
:::

## Import Substitution Industrialization

[A little more context]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- For some significant time (half of 19th to middle of 20th century) LATAM relied heavily on [exports of agricultural products and minerals]{.hi} to earn foreign revenue

- These sectors were either developed or owned by foreign capital or if domestically owned, it usually was concentrated in the power of a few relatively small number of people which added to growing inequality of power and wealth

- The loss of markets due to the [Great Depression]{.hp} temporarily forced the region [away from depending on raw material exports toward domestic industrial development through production of manufactured goods that substitue for imports]{.hp}

[Goals of ISI]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Reduce Dependency on Imports
- Promote Industrializtion
- Achieve Economic Self-Sufficiency
- Create Jobs and Economic Growth
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Methods of ISI]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Tariffs and Import Restrictions
- Subsisdies and Government Support
- State-Owned Enterprises 
- Exchange Rate Controls
- Local Content Requirements
:::

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- By producing domestically what was previously imported, countries seek to lessen reliance on foreing goods
- ISI aims to accelerate the development of domestic manufacturing industries
- Reduce reliance on foreign markets helps protect against external economic shocks
- Encouraging local production generates employment and stimulates economic activity

- High tariffs, quotas, and import bans are used
- Governments provide financial incentives, tax breaks, and direct subsidies
- Governments may establish or nationalize indutries deemed essential for development
- Overvalued exchange rates make imports more expensive and domestic capital goods relatively cheaper
- Policies that require foreign firms to wource inputs from domestic producers

## ISI Pros & Cons

[In theory]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .small}
- ISI begins by producing inexpensive and relatively simple consumer goods
    - Toys, clothing, food products, etc.
- Gradually, the focus shifts toward more complex consumer goods and intermediate industrial goods
    - Generators, appliances, autos, basic metals, etc.
- Eventually, complex industrial goods are produced
    - Chemicals, electronics, machine tools, etc.

## ISI Pros & Cons {.smaller}

[Criticisms]{.hi}

In hindsight, ISI generated a lot of [unintended consequences that caused inefficiencies and wasted resources]{.hp}

::: {.fragment}
- Overall, ISI can be interpreted as a set of policies in which government uses its economic and political power to improve the market
- But many economists think that ISI overestimates the technical ability of government officials to identify market failures and their solutions
- It largely ignores problems related to the implementation of economic policies
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Cons]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Governments misallocated resources when they became too involved in production decisions
- Exchange rates were often overvalued
- Policy was overly biased in favor of urban areas
- Income inequality worsened
- It fostered widespread rent seeking
