## Background: The US is Huge

---

## Background

[Post-World War II]{.h}

- The US has used its size, wealth and military power to create their international economic relations which promote international trade, finance, and support for low- and middle-income countries

::: {.incremental}
- Over time, many [emerging markets]{.hi} succeeded and the world economy rebalanced
- The US desire of an open, multilateral world order has [decreased]{.hp}
- Support for [unilateralism and nationalism]{.hp} has gone up
- Support for international institutions which were set up to support the world economic order has also fallen

## US and Trade

Although trade represents a small share of GDP, there has been an upward trend in this ratio

## Trade Relations

US trading partners have remained pretty consistent (and the Gravity Model can explain it well)

## Shift in Trade Strategy

Over the last two decades, the US has shifted their [trade strategy]{.h} away from [multilateral negotiations]{.hi} and began to favor [bilateral/plurilateral negotiations]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Multilateral Negotiations]{.hi .align-center .underline}

::: {.incremental}
- Involve many countries, usually on a global scale
- Conducted under [international organization framework]{.h} like the WTO
- Aims to create broad and stardardized trade rules that apply to all members
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Bilateral/Plurilateral Negotiations]{.hi .align-center .underline}

::: {.incremental}
- Involve two (bi) or more (pluri) but fewer than all WTO members
- Can be regional (NAFTA; CAFTA-DR)
- Focus on reducing tariffs, increasing market access, and other specific trade issues
:::

:::

::::

:::

## Shift in Trade Strategy

There are [several factors]{.hi} that help explain this shift in strategy:

::: {.incremental}
- [Multilateral negotations]{.h} became more complex as more nations became members
- The focus of negotiations has shifted toward much more difficult issues (intellectual property, trade of services, emerging market assistance, etc.)
- The end of the Cold War meant that the US no longer has a need to compromise or offer asymmetric access to the US market
- Rise of nations that were previously relatively unimportant in world markets (China, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, India, etc.)
:::

## Bilateral/Plurilateral Agreements

[NAFTA]{.hi} was the first earnest attempt to move toward bilateral trade solutions

- It was signed in 1993 and went into effect in 1994

- First to include labor and environmental standards

::: {.fragment}
- Importantly, it gave the US additional leverage in multilateral negotiations as it helped signal that there are other negotiation options beyond the GATT/WTO setting
:::

## US Free Trade Agreements

- The US currently has [Free Trade Agreements (FTA)]{.h} with twenty countries grouped into three strategic geographical regions

    - Middle East & North Africa | Pacific Basin | The Americas

## The US, Mexico & Canada

Trade between the US, Mexico, and Canada is very large and significant to the world economy

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- 493.4 M people combined 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Over $24 Trillion in combined GDP
:::

::: {.fragment}
![](images/NAFTA-Demos.png){height="350" fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.notes}
- Roughly the same size as the 27 nations of the EU (446M)
- And their GDP (15.6)
- The region also is relatively wealthy (49,000 GDP per capita)
:::

## The North American Free Trade Agreement

Ratified in 1993, implemented in 1994

A modification called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was negotiated in 2018, ratified and implemented in 2020

::: {.incremental}
- The US and Canada already had relatively open economies with few trade barriers through the [Auto Pact (1965) and CUSTA (1989)]{.hi}

    - This wasn't without its opponents which primarily argued that:

        1. Issues of Canadian firms competitiveness against US firms
        2. Concern about erosion of Canadian social programs
        3. The possibility of US cultural domination

## Important Features of NAFTA - Trade Barriers

[Tariff reductions were a key point to increase trade amongst the members]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- The US already had relatively low tariffs on Mexico: 
    - Between 1993 and 1996, the average US tariff on Mexican goods fell from 2.07 to 0.65 percent

- Mexican tariffs on US goods fell from 10 to 2.9 percent

- Tariffs were phases out in variable periods with the intent to give domestic industries sufficient time to adjust to new circumstances

:::

::: {.fragment}
- These reductions were a continuation of efforts since the mid-1980s

- By 1994, Mexico was substantially open to the world
:::

---

## Important Features of NAFTA - Content Reqs

[A specified percentage of the value of the good must be made in North America]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- One of the updates made by [USMCA]{.h} increased the content requirements
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The purpose is to prevent nonmembers from using the lower tariffs in one country to gain access to all three markets
    - Economists dislike this because it incresaes the possibility of [trade diversion (inefficient allocation of resources)]{.h}
    - 
:::

::: {.notes}
Production of inputs in lower-cost, nonmember countries could be reduced if firms move their operations to one of the member countreis in order to meet the content requirements

Move from the Caribbean to Mexico, even though Mexico is not the lowest-cost producer
:::

---

## Important Features of NAFTA - Dispute Resolution

[Set up dispute resolution depending on the source of the disagreement]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Dumping and anti-dumping duties
- Treatment of foreign investors by national policies [(investor-state disputes)]{.h}
- General disputes
- [Labor and Environmental standards]{.hp} 
:::

::: {.fragment}
The [investor-state dispute article]{.h} was one of the most controversial parts of the entire agreement.

- Critics see it as an unreasonable empowerment of private firms and a weakening of governments
:::

---

## Important Features of NAFTA - Migration

[Because NAFTA is a free trade area and not a common market, there is no provision for the movement of labor]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
This is usually the norm in FTAs but the US-MEX context makes it an important issue to consider
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Mexican migrants to the US totaled more than 11.1 million in 2018 and were 25% of all immigrants
- There's an estimate that over one-half of this population is undocumented
- There has been a decline in the rate of migrants from Mexico since the early 2000s
- Even so, the vast number of migrants remains significant and makes it an important issue between both countries
:::

## FTA Trade Balance

The US has [much less unbalanced trade]{.hi} with the countries that have signed FTAs

::: {.fragment}
When countries enter an FTA, the elimination of trade barriers will usually be greater outside of the US

[As foreign barriers decline, US exports grow]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.notes}
Recall that with increased trade, consumers have more choices and businesses are more competitive when they have greater access to imports
