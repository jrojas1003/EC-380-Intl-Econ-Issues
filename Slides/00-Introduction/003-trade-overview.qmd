## International Integration (Good & Bad)

Generally, we think of integration of nations to bring many benefits

- Innovation in products/services

- More affordable goods

- Flow of investments toward scarce resource nations

But this process can also make [nations vulnerable to foreign economic problems]{.h}

. . .

- The Great Recession was a US Housing and Banking crisis 

- The 1970s oil price shocks 

- The Covid Pandemic 

::: {.notes}
- that leaked to the world
- led to many Latin American countries having account deficits due to foreign debt accumulation
- meant that exporting nations were not able to produce at the same pace which slowed down all economies through trade flow linkages

## Trade Integration

Let's define it

[Trade Integration]{.hi} can be roughly measured through 4 criteria:

::: {.incremental}
- Trade Flows
- Capital Flows
- People/Labor Flows
- Similarity of prices in different markets

## Importance of Trade Varies by Country

## Trade Overview

- Trade is important to nations and increasingly so
- Flows of Trade (Imports/Exports) represent a large proportion of nations GDP
- Trade openness varies by country size

. . .

Questions come to mind:

- Why do countries trade so much? 
- What do they gain from trading?
- How does trade impact other aspects of the economy (labor market, geopolitics, etc)?

## How Did They End Up There?

Countries [specialize]{.h} and export core products

- Trading goods that they are ["best"]{.h} at producing results in [gains from trade]{.hi-green}

- [Specialization]{.h} comes from where each country has a [Comparative Advantage]{.h}

. . .

What factors, other than the fundamentals, influence specialization?

::: {.incremental}
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

- Knowledge Sharing/Diffusion

- Cross-border Migration Shocks 

- And much more

## Why Does Trade Continue to Grow?

[Trade is not frictionless. There are costs to trading with other nations]{.h .note}

Trade growth can be largely attributed to reduced trade barriers over time

This is called [trade liberalization]{.hi} 

. . .

Some examples are:

::: {.incremental}

- Costs of shipping/transport are lower

- Tariff rate reductions

- Preferential Trade Agreements

- Relaxing non-tariff measures (quotas)
:::

## Reduced Tariff Rates

## Economics Can Be Very Complex 

- Explicit trade barriers have fallen over time, coinciding with the growth of trade relative to economic activity

- Hidden barriers are the next hurdle. Much of the current literature suggests is far more impactful than existing tariff rates

    - Current trade theory and literature focuss on [heterogenous agent models]{.hi-red}, which was orignally created to explain why not every firm functions as an exporter

- We [will not]{.h} be diving that deep into international trade. 
Our primary goal is to get a good understanding of how/why it works and understanding basic dynamics.

::: {.notes}
- Hidden barriers can be subsidies, labor clauses in FTAs, quality requirements, etc.

## Overview of Trade Theory

[Why does trade occur?]{.hi-red} This is our main question. 

There are two strands within the field of international trade:

. . .

[I. Neoclassical Models of Trade ('Old Theories')]{.h}:

::: {.fragment}
- Ricardian Model $\Rightarrow$ Technology differences spur trade
- Hecksher-Ohlin Model $\Rightarrow$ Resource differences spur trade 
:::

[II. 'New' Trade Theory]{.h}:

::: {.fragment}
- Krugman Model $\Rightarrow$ Demand/Want of variety spurs trade
- Melits Model $\Rightarrow$ Heterogenous firms drive trade
:::

---

## Next Steps {.small}

We will begin to look at the theory, starting with the [Ricardo Model]{.hi}. 
It involves:

- Single factor of production (labor)
- Two countries (home,foreign)
- Technology differences across countries

It will be key to note the models attributes as they will all have some key differences. 
Each model will also have predictable outcomes.
