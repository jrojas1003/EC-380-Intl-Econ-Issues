## In-Class Activity

Every other week on Wednesdays we will be creating our own world market

- The class will be split into countries (groups of 7) 

- Each time the economy will have different rules that affect how you do things

- The goal is to give you an interactive component rather than just lectures, homeworks and exams

[**Note:** This is the first time I do this so there might be some hiccups. The activity itself is fairly simple but sometimes I find myself thinking what are you actually learning here]{.note .small}
