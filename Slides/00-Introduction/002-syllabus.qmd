## Class Information 

- [**Schedule:**]{.hi} Monday & Wednesday in McKenzie 125

- [**Office Hours:**]{.hi} Wednesdays from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm 

**Lectures**

- Slides are meant to complement the lectures, not substitute them

- I will lecture, go through example problems, ask you to solve things, etc

- By being in lecture, the ideal goal is for you to understand things beyond the textbook 

---

## In-Class Activity

Every so often we will be creating our own world market

- The class will be split into countries (groups of 8) 

- Each time the economy will have different rules and circumstances

- The goal is to give you an interactive component rather than just lectures, homeworks and exams

[**Note:** This is the first time I do this so there might be some hiccups. The activity itself is fairly simple but sometimes I find myself thinking what are you actually learning here]{.note .small}
