## Autarky

[Definition:]{.h} The complete absence of foreign trade; total self-sufficiency of a national economy

To understand how trade affects national welfare, we have to understand how they do on their own

We can do this by looking at the [Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)]{.hi-blue}

- These show the trade-offs when a country chooses their production combination of two goods
- It is closely related to the opportunity cost of the good on the [horizontal axis]{.hi}

---

## Production Possibilities Curves (PPC)

For the moment, we will be dealing with PPCs that look like straight lines because [we assume that the trade-off between two goods does not change]{.hii}

- [This follows from an assumption we make on labor:]{.h} Labor is homogeneous and no group of workers is more skilled than another group

. . .

How are they related to opportunity costs?

- [Opportunity costs are the best forgone alternative]{.hi-orange}: In order to produce 1 unit of good X, the country has to give up some amount of good Y. 

    - Because this is a "rate of change", we say that the [slope of the PPC]{.hi-orange} is the [Opportunity Cost of good X]{.hi-orange}

Choice depends on the country's demand for the two goods

- Each curve shows the consumption bundles of goods that the economy can consume and be equally satisfied

- The consumers are [indifferent]{.h} in its own preference across the bundles on a particular indifference curve

## Back to the Ricardo Model

Starting with the [Ricardo Model]{.hi-red}, we look at it's primary components:

::: {.incremental}
- Single Factor of Production (Labor)
- Two-Country Model (Home and Foreign)
- Technology differences across countries
:::

::: {.fragment}
[We will use our own example]{.align-center} 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Factor of production: [Labor (L)]{.h}
- Two Countries: [Home]{.hi-red} and [Foreign]{.hi-teal}
- Two Goods: [Coffee and Tea]{.hi}
:::

::: {.column .small width="40%"}

::: {.fragment}
- Suppose that in this case, the [Home Country]{.hi-red} exports [coffee]{.hi-teal} and imports [tea]{.hi-teal}

## Ricardo Model Assumptions

## Creating PPFs {.small}

Let each country have a [labor force size of 10]{.h} and [productions]{.h} be:

![](images/autarky-economy.png){fig-align="center" height="250"}

[We find the PPF intercepts by seeing how much a country will produce if their entire work force only produces one good]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Home would produce:]{.hi-red .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    &\text{Coffee:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 9 = 90 \\
    &\text{Tea:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 7 = 70
\end{align*}
::: 


---

## Home PPF {.small}

![](images/Home-PPF-01.png){fig-align="center"}

[Slope of PPF is Opportunity Cost of Good X]{.hi-orange .align-center}

Which is how much units of tea do I give up to make one more unit of coffee

$$
    \text{Slope of PPF} = \dfrac{\Delta \text{Tea Ouptut}}{\Delta \text{Coffee Output}} = \dfrac{-7}{9} = \text{(-)Opportunity Cost of Coffee}
$$

---

## Introducing some Key Variables - Marginal Product of Labor

[Marginal Product of Labor (MPL):]{.h} Represents the [additional units of a good produced]{.hi-green}, given a [one unit increase in the number of workers assigned]{.hi-green} to a particular task

. . .

The MPL for the [Home Country]{.hi-red} for each good is written as $\text{MPL}_{c}^{H}$ and $\text{MPL}_{t}^{H}$, for [coffee]{.hi} and [tea]{.hi} respectively. 

We can assign numbers to each such that:

. . .

$$
    \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} = 9 \;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\; \text{MPL}_{t}^{H} = 7 
$$

Let's also say that the country has a full labor force $\bar{L} = 10$

We will add the [Foreign Country]{.hi-teal} later

---

## Home PPF

We can plot the [Home PPF]{.hi-red} by finding the intercepts for each good. 
We can do this by multiplying the marginal product of labor by the workforce size

$$
    \text{MPL}_{\text{good}}^{\text{country}} * \bar{L}
$$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
The [Home Country]{.hi-red} produces

\begin{align*}
    Q_{\text{coffee}}^{H} &= 9 * 10 = 90 \\ \\
    Q_{\text{tea}}^{H} &= 7 * 10 = 70
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/Home-PPF-01.png){fig-align="center" height="350"}
:::

::::

---

## Home PPF

[Assume:]{.h .note} PPF is a straight line due to the constant [MPLs]{.h}

[Slope of PPF:]{.h .note} Equal to the marginal rate of substitution between goods ([Coffee & Tea]{.hi})

$$
    \text{Slope of PPF}^{H} = -\dfrac{\text{MPL}_{t}}{\text{MPL}_{c}} = -\dfrac{7}{9}
$$

This is also the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of [coffee]{.hi}. So we can say that if we want one more unit of [coffee]{.hi} we must trade off [tea]{.hi} at a rate of $\dfrac{7}{9}$

Equivalently, the [opportunity cost]{.hi-orange} of [tea]{.hi} would be $\dfrac{9}{7}$ units of [coffee]{.hi}

---

## Home Prices 

We can determine prices in the country from this information as well. 
We assume to be under [Perfect Competition]{.hi} which means that all goods are sold at cost. 

[Prices]{.h .align-center}

These are in terms relative to both goods and [measured in units]{.h}:

$$
    P_{c}^{H} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{t}}{\text{MPL}_{c}} = \dfrac{7}{9} \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; P_{t}^{H} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{c}}{\text{MPL}_{t}} = \dfrac{9}{7}
$$

---

## Home Wages

We use the [Perfect Competition]{.hi} assumptions to also determine wages

[Wages]{.h .align-center}

Workers are paid the equivalent of their MPL times the price of that additional unit they produce:

\begin{align*}
    \text{wages}_{\text{coffee}} &= \text{P}_{\text{coffee}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}} \\ \\
    \text{wages}_{\text{tea}} &= \text{P}_{\text{tea}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{tea}}
\end{align*}

## Home Wages Across Industries 

Additionally, because we assume that labor moves freely between industries, we can assume that wages are equalized across industries

$$
    \text{wages}_{\text{coffee}} = \text{P}_{\text{coffee}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}} = \text{P}_{\text{tea}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{tea}} = \text{wages}_{\text{tea}}
$$

. . .

<br>

We can rearrange this such that the price ratio is equal to the MPL ratio

$$
    \dfrac{\text{P}_{\text{coffee}}}{\text{P}_{\text{tea}}} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{\text{tea}}}{\text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}}}
$$

Relative price of coffee is equal to the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of coffee at the [autarky/no-trade equilibrium]{.hi-red}

---

## Foreign PPF, Prices, and Wages

We can find the [Foreign Country]{.hi-teal} results as well

Find them for yourself and we will pick it up next class. Let:

$$
    \text{MPL}_{c}^{F} = 10 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \text{MPL}_{t}^{F} = 12 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \bar{L} = 10
$$

## Comparing Countries 

![](images/Both-PPF.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Who Has the Advantage?

We can compare both countries and determine who has an advantage in production

We work with two types of advantages:

::: {.incremental}
- [Absolute Advantage:]{.hi} If the country produces more per labor input
- [Comparative Advantage:]{.hi} If the country's [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of producing a good is lower than the other country
:::

---

## Who Has the Advantage?

Now we have two countries, we can begin to compare their [Marginal Productivities of Labor]{.hi}

- A nation has the [Absolute Advantage in a good]{.h} if they produce more per labor input

- A nation has the [Comparative Advantage]{.hi} if the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of producing a good is lower than that of the other country

## Choosing Production Based on Preferences

Under [Autarky]{.hi}, every country has to produce as much as they want to consume

We saw that the production bundle is determined by the country indifference curve

::: {.incremental}
- We won't go into how we determine preferences, but we will figure out how to get exact bundles based on a pre-determined mix of goods

- We are looking for a point where 2 curves (lines) touch

    - Which is equivalent to finding out at which coordinates they are equal to each other

    - We will have [2 equations (PPF & Preferences) and 2 unknowns (Good X and Good Y)]{.h}
:::

---

## Choosing Production - Example

Let there be two countries, one belongs to the [Vampires]{.hi} and the other to the [Wolves]{.hi-red} with the following productivities and a labor force size of $\bar{L} = 20$

![](images/autarky-demand-example.png){fig-align="center"}

We will focus on the [Vampires]{.hi} for this example:

- They have prefer to consume [3 Sparkling Selfies for every 2 Shirtless Selfies]{.h}

- We will find how many [Sparkling and Shirtless]{.h} selfies the [Vampires]{.hi} need to produce in order to satisfy demand

---

![](images/autarky-demand-example.png){fig-align="left"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

We will:

:::{.incremental}
- Find the PPF intercepts
- Find the proportion in which they prefer to consume the goods
- Determine the PPF line
- Set preferences proportion equal to PPF line and solve
:::

:::

## Find PPF Intercepts

Looking only at the [Vampires]{.hi} with $\bar{L} = 20$

![](images/autarky-demand-example-01.png){fig-align="center"}

We need to find the maximum they can produce for each good:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Sparkling]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Max Sparkling} &= \text{MPL}_{spark} * \bar{L} \\
    \text{Max Sparkling} &= 12 * 20 \\
    \text{Max Sparkling} &= 240
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Shirtless]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Max Shirtless} &= \text{MPL}_{shirt} * \bar{L} \\
    \text{Max Shirtless} &= 4 * 20 \\
    \text{Max Shirtless} &= 80
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::::

---

## Preference in Consuming Goods

We were told that [Vampires Consumers]{.hi} prefer to consume [3 Sparkling]{.h} selfies for every [2 Shirtless]{.h} selfies

Let's see how this translates to our indifference curve concept 

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{\text{Sparkling}}{\text{Shirtless}} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{\text{Sparkling}}{\text{Shirtless}} &= \dfrac{3}{2} \\
    2 * \text{Sparkling} &= 3 * \text{Shirtless} \\
    \dfrac{2}{3} * \text{Sparkling} &= \text{Shirtless}
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.notes}
We can write this as a proportion, then we can solve for either of the goods

This will help us in finding that optimal bundle
:::

## Determining the PPF Line

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](images/autarky-demand-example-02.png){fig-align="left"}

<br><br>

[The PPF Line]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Y} &= b \pm mx \\
    \text{Y} &= 80 - \dfrac{80}{240} * x \\
    \text{Y} &= 80 - \dfrac{1}{3} * x

\end{align*}
:::

:::

::::

---

## Putting It Altogether

Because we are finding where [Production]{.h} equals [Demand]{.h}, we are finding where these two equations equal each other

$$
    \text{Shirtless} = \dfrac{2}{3} * \text{Sparkling} \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \text{Shirtless} = 80 - \dfrac{1}{3} * \text{Sparkling}
$$  

::: {.fragment .small}

\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{2}{3} * \text{Sparkling} &= 80 - \dfrac{1}{3} * \text{Sparkling} \\
    \left(\dfrac{2}{3} + \dfrac{1}{3} \right) * \text{Sparkling} &= 80 \\ 
    (1) * \text{Sparkling} &= 80 \\ 
    \text{Sparkling} &= 80
\end{align*}
:::

---

## Putting It Altogether

We know that [Vampires]{.hi} will make [80 Sparkling]{.h} selfies

Now we need to find how many [Shirtless]{.h} selfies they make:

There are two ways to find this out:

$$
    \text{Shirtless} = \dfrac{2}{3} * \text{Sparkling} \;\;\;\;\; \text{or} \;\;\;\;\; \text{Shirtless} = 80 - \dfrac{1}{3} * \text{Sparkling}
$$  

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Shirtless} &= \dfrac{2}{3} * 80 \\
    \text{Shirtless} &\approx 53.3
\end{align*}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Shirtless} &= 80 - \dfrac{1}{3} * 80 \\
    \text{Shirtless} &= 80 - 26.67 \\
    \text{Shirtless} &\approx 53.3
\end{align*}

## Results!

By knowing in which proportion consumers prefer their goods, we can find how much the country will produce under [autarky]{.hii}

::: {.fragment}
We could also figure out what happens to production if there is some form of shock to the economy, for example: 

::: {.incremental}
- Preferences change
- Labor increases/decreases
- Productivities change
