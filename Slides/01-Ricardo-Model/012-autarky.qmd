## Autarky

[Definition:]{.h} The complete absence of foreign trade; total self-sufficiency of a national economy

To understand how trade affects national welfare, we have to understand how they do on their own

We can do this by looking at the [Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)]{.hi-blue}

- These show the trade-offs when a country chooses their production combination of two goods
- It is closely related to the opportunity cost of the good on the [horizontal axis]{.hi}

---

## Production Possibilities Curves (PPC)

For the moment, we will be dealing with PPCs that look like straight lines because [we assume that the trade-off between two goods does not change]{.hii}

- [This follows from an assumption we make on labor:]{.h} Labor is homogeneous and no group of workers is more skilled than another group

. . .

How are they related to opportunity costs?

- [Opportunity costs are the best forgone alternative]{.hi-orange}: In order to produce 1 unit of good X, the country has to give up some amount of good Y. 

    - Because this is a "rate of change", we say that the [slope of the PPC]{.hi-orange} is the [Opportunity Cost of good X]{.hi-orange}

Choice depends on the country's demand for the two goods

We call these [Indifference Curves]{.h}

- Each curve shows the consumption bundles of goods that the economy can consume and be equally satisfied

- The consumers are [indifferent]{.h} in its own preference across the bundles on a particular indifference curve

## Back to the Ricardo Model

Starting with the [Ricardo Model]{.hi-red}, we look at it's primary components:

::: {.incremental}
- Single Factor of Production (Labor)
- Two-Country Model (Home and Foreign)
- Technology differences across countries
:::

::: {.fragment}
[We will use our own example]{.align-center} 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Factor of production: [Labor (L)]{.h}
- Two Countries: [Home]{.hi-red} and [Foreign]{.hi-teal}
- Two Goods: [Coffee and Tea]{.hi}
:::

::: {.column .small width="40%"}

::: {.fragment}
- Suppose that in this case, the [Home Country]{.hi-red} exports [coffee]{.hi-teal} and imports [tea]{.hi-teal}
- [What would this imply about which good each country has comparative advantage in?]{.hi-orange}

## Creating PPFs {.small}

Let each country have a [labor force size of 10]{.h} and [productions]{.h} be:

![](images/autarky-economy.png){fig-align="center" height="250"}

[We find the PPF intercepts by seeing how much a country will produce if their entire work force only produces one good]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Home would produce:]{.hi-red .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    &\text{Coffee:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 9 = 90 \\
    &\text{Tea:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 7 = 70
\end{align*}

## Home PPF {.small}

![](images/Home-PPF-01.png){fig-align="center"}

[Slope of PPF is Opportunity Cost of Good X]{.hi-orange .align-center}

Which is how much units of tea do I give up to make one more unit of coffee

$$
    \text{Slope of PPF} = \dfrac{\Delta \text{Tea Ouptut}}{\Delta \text{Coffee Output}} = \dfrac{-7}{9} = \text{(-)Opportunity Cost of Coffee}
$$

## Foreign PPF

[Foreign]{.hi-teal} produces [10 Coffee]{.hi} and [12 Tea]{.hi}

[Foreign would produce:]{.hi-teal .align-center}

[\begin{align*}
    &\text{Coffee:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 10 = 100 \\
    &\text{Tea:} \; L * \text{units} = 10 * 12 = 120
\end{align*}]{.small}

[\begin{align*}
    &\text{Slope} = \dfrac{\Delta \text{Tea Ouptut}}{\Delta \text{Coffee Output}} = \dfrac{-10}{12}

## Comparing Countries

## Who Has the Advantage?

We can compare both countries and determine who has an advantage in production

We work with two types of advantages:

::: {.incremental}
- [Absolute Advantage:]{.hi} If the country produces more per labor input
- [Comparative Advantage:]{.hi} If the country's [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of producing a good is lower than the other country
