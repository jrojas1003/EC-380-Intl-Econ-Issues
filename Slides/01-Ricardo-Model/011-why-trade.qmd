name: why trade

## Quick Recap

[Why does trade occur?]{.hi-red} This is our main question. 

There are two strands within the field of international trade:

[I. Neoclassical Models of Trade ('Old Theories')]{.h}:

- [Ricardian Model $\Rightarrow$ Technology differences spur trade]{.hi-red}
- [Hecksher-Ohlin Model $\Rightarrow$ Resource differences spur trade]{.hi-grey} 

[II. 'New' Trade Theory]{.h}:

- [Krugman Model $\Rightarrow$ Demand/Want of variety spurs trade]{.hi-grey} 
- [Melits Model $\Rightarrow$ Heterogenous firms drive trade]{.hi-grey}

## US Imports Snapshot

In 2022, the US imported $316M in Toothbrushes.  
Roughly 56% from China alone. 
Next noticeable sources are Germany, Switzerland, and India.

. . .

<br>
The US represents the largest economy in the world. 
But it still [resorts to import of goods]{.hii} at a level that far exceeds what it exports.

. . .

<br>
As an example, while 99% of shipping containers that enter the Los Angeles port are fully loaded with goods, [70% of containers leaving the port are empty]{.hi-red}!

## Reasons for Trade

With all the manufacturing capacity of the US, why not make toothbrushes at home and consume them domestically?

::: {.incremental}
- Technology differences in each country?
- Total resources available differ by country?
- Production cost differences?
- Proximity to countries with more productive labor forces?
:::

. . .

For now, let's consider the [opportunity cost]{.hi-orange} of doing so. 
[The Ricardian Perspective]{.h} says that the US devotes domestic labor that would otherwise be used to produce these toothbrushes to [comparatively]{.hi-orange} more productive tasks.

## Comparative Advantage

During the 16th and 17th century, the study of economics was in its infancy.
Misguided beliefs in public policy were widely held across nations.

> [Mercantalism:]{.hi} A stockpile of gold and silver was considered an appropriate barometer for the state of the domestic economy
>
> [Imports]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ Less gold
>
> [Exports]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ More gold
>
> Tariffs are set high to prevent trade deficits'

[Ricardo]{.h} would demonstrate that under [balanced free trade (no tariffs)]{.hi}, trade then [benefits every country]{.h}

---

## Ricardo's Logic

If every country exports the goods in which they have the [comparative advantage]{.hi-red} in, then every country benefits from trade

Let's view at an example

::: {.incremental}
- Two countries: Portugal and England
- Two goods: Wine and Cloth
- Portugal has the [absolute advantage]{.hi-red} in production of both goods
- England is particularly bad at making wine, which makes it [relatively good]{.hi-green} at producing cloth
:::

. . .

England has the [comparative advantage]{.hi-orange} in cloth. Portugal has the [comparative advantage]{.hi-orange} in wine. 

[Ricardo]{.h} says that [both]{.h} are better off trading than under [autarky]{.hi-bb}
