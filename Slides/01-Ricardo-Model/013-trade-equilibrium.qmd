## Why Would Foreign Trade?

[Foreign]{.hi-teal} is outright better at producing [Coffee & Tea]{.hi} than [Home]{.hi-red}.
How could they benefit from trading with a less productive country?

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- If [Foreign]{.hi-teal} doesn't trade, they are bound by their own production possibilities. 
With trade, they can exceed their own production capacities, [even when they hold an Absolute Advantage]{.h}

- The same logic can be applied to [Home]{.hi-red}. 
They will be able to exceed domestic production capacity by trading.

- To trade, both nations must be better off from doing so. 
This will mean that the [relative price]{.h} of the good should fall somewhere in between both markets

- Prices for each country are just the [opportunity costs of the good]{.hi-orange}

## Free Trade

There are gains to be had for [both countries to benefit from trade]{.h}. 
How do we determine who produces what?

::: {.incremental}
- The pattern of exports and imports is determined by [Opportunity Costs]{.hi-orange} of production in each country.

- Countries will [export]{.h} the good in which they have the [Comparative Advantage]{.hi} and [import]{.h} the other good $\Rightarrow$ they will [specialize and only produce the export good]{.h}

- We can think of this in terms prices as well:

    - The price of coffee at [Home is 7/9]{.hi-red} and at [Foreign is 12/10]{.hi-teal}
    - There is a higher return for [Home Producers]{.hi-red} to sell their coffee in [Foreign]{.hi-teal} so they will [export]{.h}
:::

::: {.notes}
The same logic can be applied to tea and you will see that [Foreign Producers]{.hi-teal} will export to [Home]{.hi-red} for a higher return

## Gains From Trade With No Absolute Advantage

What matters most for the purposes of trade is not a country's [absolute advantage]{.h} but its [comparative advantage]{.h}

- Differences in [absolute advantage]{.h} do not eliminate gains from trade

. . .

Up until now, we have not mentioned wage differences across countries.

- This is something that is usually talked about in the real world when we hear about concerns of exploitation in foreign countries or offshoring of jobs

## Living Standards / Incomes Across Countries

The price of goods we just found were [relative prices]{.h} which means it is a ratio of the value of one good over the other

We assumed $P_{c}^{W} = 1$ which means that the [actual]{.hi} price of goods are equal to each other, [not that one unit of coffee is worth $1]{.h}

Knowing [relative prices]{.h} allows us to find [relative wages]{.h} as well:

::: {.incremental}
- Economies operate under Perfect Competition which implies zero profits
    - Workers are paid at cost of producing the good
- Workers earn "units of goods" they produce
- Since we know [relative prices]{.h}, we can figure out [relative wages]{.h}
:::

## Living Standards / Incomes Across Countries

Let the price of a unit of coffee be $3. 
If the relative world price is 1, then what is the world price of tea?

::: {.fragment}
- Price of tea is also $3
:::

. . .

Each [Home worker]{.hi-red} makes 9 units of coffee per labor unit. 
Since they get paid what they produce, wages are simply:

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    \text{wage}_{c}^{H} = \text{productivity} * P_{c}^{W} = 9 * 3 = 27
$$
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    \text{wage}_{t}^{F} = \text{productivity} * P_{t}^{W} = 12 * 3 = 36
$$
:::

::: {.fragment .small .align-center}
The [relative wage]{.h} of [Home workers]{.hi-red} is $\dfrac{w^{H}}{w^{F}} = \dfrac{27}{36} = \dfrac{3}{4}$

## Flaws of the Ricardo Model

The [Ricardian Model]{.h} does a great job at providing a basic prediction that countries should tend to export goods in which they have relatively high productivity

- This has been confirmed by studies over the years

But it is not without some faults:

- It predicts an [extreme degree of specialization]{.hi} that we do not observe in the real world
- It assumes away effects of trade on the [distribution of incomes within countries]{.hi} which ignores the fact that not all benefit from trade equally
- Misses differences in resources among countries 
    - Our next model addresses this
