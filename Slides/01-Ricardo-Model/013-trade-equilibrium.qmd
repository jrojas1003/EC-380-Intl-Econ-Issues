## Why Would Foreign Trade?

[Foreign]{.hi-teal} is outright better at producing [Coffee & Tea]{.hi} than [Home]{.hi-red}.
How could they benefit from trading with the inferior country?

. . .

If [Foreign]{.hi-teal} doesn't trade, they are bound by their own production possibilities. 
With trade, they can exceed their own production capacities, [even when they hold an Absolute Advantage]{.h}

The same logic can be applied to [Home]{.hi-red}. 
They will be able to exceed domestic production capacity by trading.
