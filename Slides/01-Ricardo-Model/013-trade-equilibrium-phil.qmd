## Why Would Foreign Trade?

[Foreign]{.hi-teal} is outright better at producing [Coffee & Tea]{.hi} than [Home]{.hi-red}.
How could they benefit from trading with the inferior country?

. . .

If [Foreign]{.hi-teal} doesn't trade, they are bound by their own production possibilities. 
With trade, they can exceed their own production capacities, [even when they hold an Absolute Advantage]{.h}

The same logic can be applied to [Home]{.hi-red}. 
They will be able to exceed domestic production capacity by trading.

To trade, both nations must be better off from doing so. 
This will mean that the price of the good should fall somewhere in between both markets

$$
    P_{c}^{H} < P_{c}^{W} < P_{c}^{F}
$$

## Free Trade

<br>

Now that we have established that both countries benefit from trade, how do we determine who produces what?

. . . 

<br><br>

The pattern of exports and imports is determined by [Opportunity Costs]{.hi-orange} of production in each country, which identifies each country's pattern of [Comparative Advantage]{.hi}

---

## Free Trade Prices

Since the [relative price]{.hi-purple} of [coffee]{.hi} is $7/9$ at [Home]{.hi-red} but $12/10$ in [Foreign]{.hi-teal}, there is an incentive to export [Home's]{.hi-red} [coffee]{.hi} to [Foreign]{.hi-teal} for a higher return

. . .

Alternatively, the relative price of [tea]{.hi} is:

$$
    P^{H}_{t} = \dfrac{9}{7} > \dfrac{10}{12} = P^{F}_{t}
$$

Since [tea]{.hi} sells better in [Home]{.hi-red}, [Foreign]{.hi-teal} is incentivized to export their [tea]{.hi} to [Home]{.hi-red}

. . .

The [Ricardo Model]{.h} predicts that [Home exports Coffee]{.hi-red} and [Foreign exports Tea]{.hi-teal}

---

## Free Trade Dynamics

As [Home exports coffee $\uparrow$]{.hi-red}, the local supply $\downarrow$ (making it more scarce)

- Less local supply $\Rightarrow$ Higher [coffee price at Home]{.hi-red}

- Higher [Foreign supply]{.hi-teal} $\Rightarrow$ Lower [coffee price in Foreign]{.hi-teal}

. . .

<br>

Similarly, [Foreign exports of tea]{.hi-teal} to [Home]{.hi-red} bid down prices abroad and up locally

Changes to exports and imports stop once the relative price is the same in both countries

<br>

No incentive to deviate from this point $\Rightarrow$ Equilibrium condition met

---

## Free Trade Equilibrium

What would the new [world price]{.h} of [coffee]{.hi} look like for [Home]{.hi-red} in this setting?

We first measure the world capacity to produce [coffee & tea]{.hi}. 
This is calculated by seeing how much both countries can produce if they focus their entire workforces towards a single good:

\begin{align*}
    Q^{W}_{t} &= \text{MPL}_{t}^{H} * \bar{L} + \text{MPL}_{t}^{F} * \bar{L} = 70 + 120 = 190 \\ \\
    Q^{W}_{c} &= \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} * \bar{L} + \text{MPL}_{c}^{F} * \bar{L} = 90 + 100 = 190
\end{align*}

. . .

The [World PPF's]{.h} slope is the line between these two "max" prodcution points, and it has [slope equal to -1]{.h}. 
The [World Price would be 1]{.h}.  

---

## Free Trade Equilibrium

The [World Price (1)]{.h} of [coffee]{.hi} is greater than the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of producing [coffee]{.hi} at [Home $(\dfrac{7}{9})$]{.hi-red} 

What do [Home producers]{.hi-red} do?

. . .

- They shift labor toward producing more [coffee]{.hi}

. . .

How much does labor shift?

. . .

- It depends on wages across industries

---

## Free Trade Labor Shift 

Recall [wages at home]{.hi-red} are given by:

[$$ w_{c}^{H} = \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} * P_{c}^{H} \;\;\; \& \;\;\;  w_{t}^{H} = \text{MPL}_{t}^{H} * P_{t}^{H}$$]{.small}

Also recall that under trade we have 

[$$ \dfrac{P_{c}^{H}}{P_{t}^{H}} = 1 \; , \;\; \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} = 9 \text{ and } \text{MPL}_{t}^{H} = 7 $$]{.small}

The wage ratio is given by [$\dfrac{P_{c}^{H} * \text{MPL}_{c}^{H}}{P_{t}^{H} * \text{MPL}_{t}^{H}} = 1 * \dfrac{9}{7} = \dfrac{9}{7}$]{.small}

. . .

Which implies that wages are higher in the [coffee industry]{.hi} than in the [tea industry]{.hi}

[All Home workers go work in the coffee industry]{.hi-red .align-center}

## Autarky Production & Consumption

Let's visualize the gains of trade. 
First, let's see where each country would produce & consume under [Autarky]{.hi}

Let the ICs and PPFs for each country be equal at bundles:

## Autarky Production & Consumption

Under [Autarky]{.h}, a nation consumes as much as they produce.

[Ricardo's logic]{.h} states that both countries will [enhance their welfare]{.h} by specializing and trading

## Free Trade Production & Consumption

Under [Free Trade]{.h}, both countries specialize in the good they have the [Comparative Advantage]{.hi}

- [Home]{.hi-red} consumes [more]{.h} [tea]{.hi} than they did under [Autarky]{.h} (35 $\Rightarrow$ 40)

- [Foreign]{.hi-teal} consumes [more]{.h} [coffee]{.hi} than they did under [Autarky]{.h} (30 $\Rightarrow$ 45)
:::

## Free Trade - Relative Wages

So far we have seen that there are [gains from trade]{.h} and that [trade flows are determined by comparative advantages]{.h} 

::: {.incremental}
- Prices converged, but wages do not 

- Wage levels differ across countries with trade, and [wages are determined by absolute advantage]{.hi}, not comparative advantage

    - This is a third, less-emphasized lesson of the [Ricardian Model]{.h}
:::

---

## Free Trade - Relative Wages

Due to markets being perfectly competitive, firms pay workers the value they add to production (marginal product)

Recall that $\text{MPL}_{c}^{H} = 9$. 
This is a [real wage]{.h}, measured in quantity of goods rather than money.

Workers sell the coffee they earn at the [world market price of 1]{.h}, making their real wage:

$$
    \dfrac{P_{\text{coffee}}}{P_{\text{tea}}} * \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} = 9 \;\; \text{units of tea}
$$
