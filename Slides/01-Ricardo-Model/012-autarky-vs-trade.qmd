## Autarky

[Definition:]{.h} The complete absence of foreign trade; total self-sufficiency of a national economy

To understand how trade affects national welfare, we have to understand how they do on their own

We can do this by looking at the [Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)]{.hi-blue}

- These show the trade-offs when a country chooses their production combination of two goods
- It is closely related to the opportunity cost of the good on the [horizontal axis]{.hi}

---

## Production Possibilities Curves (PPC)

For the moment, we will be dealing with PPCs that look like straight lines because [we assume that the trade-off between two goods does not change]{.hii}

- [This follows from an assumption we make on labor:]{.h} Labor is homogeneous and no group of workers is more skilled than another group

. . .

How are they related to opportunity costs?

- [Opportunity costs are the best forgone alternative]{.hi-orange}: In order to produce 1 unit of good X, the country has to give up some amount of good Y. 

    - Because this is a "rate of change", we say that the [slope of the PPC]{.hi-orange} is the [Opportunity Cost of good X]{.hi-orange}

Choice depends on the country's demand for the two goods

We call these [Indifference Curves]{.h}

- Each curve shows the consumption bundles of goods that the economy can consume and be equally satisfied

- The consumers are [indifferent]{.h} in its own preference across the bundles on a particular indifference curve

## Back to the Ricardo Model

Starting with the [Ricardo Model]{.hi-red}, we look at it's primary components:

::: {.incremental}
- Single Factor of Production (Labor)
- Two-Country Model (Home and Foreign)
- Technology differences across countries

::: {.fragment}
[We will use our own example]{.align-center}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Factor of production: [Labor (L)]{.h}

::: {.column .small width="40%"}

- Suppose that in this case, the [Home Country]{.hi-red} exports [coffee]{.hi-teal} and imports [tea]{.hi-teal}
- [What would this imply about which good each country has comparative advantage in?]{.hi-orange}

## Ricardo Model Assumptions

![](images/gerber-model-assumptions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Introducing some Key Variables - Marginal Product of Labor

[Marginal Product of Labor (MPL):]{.h} Represents the [additional units of a good produced]{.hi-green}, given a [one unit increase in the number of workers assigned]{.hi-green} to a particular task

. . .

The MPL for the [Home Country]{.hi-red} for each good is written as $\text{MPL}_{c}^{H}$ and $\text{MPL}_{t}^{H}$, for [coffee]{.hi} and [tea]{.hi} respectively. 

We can assign numbers to each such that:

. . .

$$
    \text{MPL}_{c}^{H} = 9 \;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\; \text{MPL}_{t}^{H} = 7 
$$

Let's also say that the country has a full labor force $\bar{L} = 10$

We will add the [Foreign Country]{.hi-teal} later

---

## Home PPF

We can plot the [Home PPF]{.hi-red} by finding the intercepts for each good. 
We can do this by multiplying the marginal product of labor by the workforce size

$$
    \text{MPL}_{\text{good}}^{\text{country}} * \bar{L}
$$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
The [Home Country]{.hi-red} produces

\begin{align*}
    Q_{\text{coffee}}^{H} &= 9 * 10 = 90 \\ \\
    Q_{\text{tea}}^{H} &= 7 * 10 = 70
\end{align*}

## Home PPF

[Assume:]{.h .note} PPF is a straight line due to the constant [MPLs]{.h}

[Slope of PPF:]{.h .note} Equal to the marginal rate of substitution between goods ([Coffee & Tea]{.hi})

$$
    \text{Slope of PPF}^{H} = -\dfrac{\text{MPL}_{t}}{\text{MPL}_{c}} = -\dfrac{7}{9}
$$

This is also the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of [coffee]{.hi}. So we can say that if we want one more unit of [coffee]{.hi} we must trade off [tea]{.hi} at a rate of $\dfrac{7}{9}$

Equivalently, the [opportunity cost]{.hi-orange} of [tea]{.hi} would be $\dfrac{9}{7}$ units of [coffee]{.hi}

---

## Home Prices 

We can determine prices in the country from this information as well. 
We assume to be under [Perfect Competition]{.hi} which means that all goods are sold at cost. 

[Prices]{.h .align-center}

These are in terms relative to both goods and [measured in units]{.h}:

$$
    P_{c}^{H} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{t}}{\text{MPL}_{c}} = \dfrac{7}{9} \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; P_{t}^{H} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{c}}{\text{MPL}_{t}} = \dfrac{9}{7}
$$

---

## Home Wages

We use the [Perfect Competition]{.hi} assumptions to also determine wages

[Wages]{.h .align-center}

Workers are paid the equivalent of their MPL times the price of that additional unit they produce:

\begin{align*}
    \text{wages}_{\text{coffee}} &= \text{P}_{\text{coffee}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}} \\ \\
    \text{wages}_{\text{tea}} &= \text{P}_{\text{tea}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{tea}}
\end{align*}

## Home Wages Across Industries 

Additionally, because we assume that labor moves freely between industries, we can assume that wages are equalized across industries

$$
    \text{wages}_{\text{coffee}} = \text{P}_{\text{coffee}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}} = \text{P}_{\text{tea}} * \text{MPL}_{\text{tea}} = \text{wages}_{\text{tea}}
$$

. . .

<br>

We can rearrange this such that the price ratio is equal to the MPL ratio

$$
    \dfrac{\text{P}_{\text{coffee}}}{\text{P}_{\text{tea}}} = \dfrac{\text{MPL}_{\text{tea}}}{\text{MPL}_{\text{coffee}}}
$$

Relative price of coffee is equal to the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of coffee at the [autarky/no-trade equilibrium]{.hi-red}

---

## Foreign PPF, Prices, and Wages

We can find the [Foreign Country]{.hi-teal} results as well

Find them for yourself and we will pick it up next class. Let:

$$
    \text{MPL}_{c}^{F} = 10 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \text{MPL}_{t}^{F} = 12 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \bar{L} = 10
$$

## Who has the Advantage?

Now we have two countries, we can begin to compare their [Marginal Productivities of Labor]{.hi}

- A nation has the [Absolute Advantage in a good]{.h} if they produce more per labor input

- A nation has the [Comparative Advantage]{.hi} if the [Opportunity Cost]{.hi-orange} of producing a good is lower than that of the other country
