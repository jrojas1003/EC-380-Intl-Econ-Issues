## Introduction

The HO model starts by noting that countries are [endowed with different levels of each input (factors)]{.hi}

. . .

Each output (goods) require a different technology and mixes of the various possibl inputs

Take for example coffee production. It requires:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Coffee plants
- Workers to harvest
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Expensive and large ovens
- Engineers and "Q Graders"
:::

:::

::::

. . .

The fact that some countries may [inherently have higher availability of inputs]{.h} creates [productivity differences]{.h}

---

## HO Model - Key Terms 

We define [factors]{.h} as inputs required in the production process

The fact that [factors]{.h} may be different introduces [two relative measure definitions]{.h}:

::: {.incremental}
- [Factor Abundance:]{.hi} If a particular factor $X$ represents a large share of total factors, the country is [$X$-factor abundant]{.hi-orange}
- [Factor Scarcity:]{.hi} If a country has less of a particular factor $X$ relative to other factors, the country is [$X$-factor scarce]{.hi-teal} 
:::

. . .

In the HO model we will [assume two factors of production:]{.hi-red}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
[Labor]{.hi-red .align-center}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
[Capital]{.hi-green .align-center}
:::

## HO Model - Key Terms

Since we have two factors, we can create a tool to compare them across countries: 

The [Capital-Labor Ratio]{.hi-red} allows us to assign countries into resource endowment groups

It is calculated as: 

$$
    \dfrac{\text{Capital}}{\text{Labor}} = \dfrac{K}{L}
$$

. . .

The [higher $K/L$]{.hii} is for a given country, relative to other countries, the more [capital abundant]{.hii} it is

[Which country is capital abundant?]{.h .align-center}

. . .

Using the [Capital-Labor Ratio]{.hi-red} we get

$$
    \dfrac{K_{crc}}{L_{crc}} = 0.3 \;\;\;\; ; \;\;\;\; \dfrac{K_{jap}}{L_{jap}} = 0.375
$$

## HO Model - Key Terms

The [Capital-Labor Ratio]{.hi-red} implies [factor abundancy]{.h}

The country with the [higher C-L ratio]{.hi-red} is relatively more abundant in capital

The country with the [lower C-L ratio]{.hi-red} is relatively more abundant in labor

. . .

This also has implications for factor prices:

Countries where a given factor is relatively [more abundant]{.hi} exhibit [lower input prices]{.hi} per unit of the factor

::: {.fragment}
A [labor-abundant]{.hi} country finds labor to be relatively cheaper (per unit) than the [capital-abundant]{.hi} country

It has a [comparative advantage]{.hi-orange} in labor-intensive production due to its edge in labor-costs
:::

## HO Model - Trade Theory

The [Heckscher-Ohlin Model]{.h} asserts that a country's [comparative advantage]{.hi-orange} lies in the production on goods that intensively use [relatively abundant factors]{.h}

. . .

<br> <br>

This may explain US trade patterns in which [capital-intensive]{.h} exports of jet engines and agricultural products dominate its goods outflows

- These goods are produced with a lot of physical capital and low amounts of high-skill labor (scientific, engineering, etc.)
