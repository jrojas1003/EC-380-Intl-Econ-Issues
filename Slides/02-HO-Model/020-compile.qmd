## Recap

[Previously]{.h}

- Countries with no absolute advantage in production do still trade!

- Countries that are more productive overall still benefit from trading with less productive countries

- We assumed differences in technology, but with the [internet]{.hii} and the subsequent [information age]{.hii} these differences have narrowed

. . . 

[What else could explain why and how countries trade goods?]{.h .align-center}

. . . 

<br>
The [Hecksher-Ohlin Model]{.hi} suggests that [differences in factor endowments]{.hi-red} can explain trade patterns
