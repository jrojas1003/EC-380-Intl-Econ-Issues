## Heterogeneity Across Time

We can consider the [Short-Run stickiness]{.hp} in our [HO Model]{.h} by adding some conditions:

::: {.incremental}
- Three Input Factors: [Labor (L)]{.h}, [Capital (K)]{.h}, [Land (T)]{.hi-green}
- Two Goods: Cloth and Food
- Production Functions:
    - $Q_{c} = f(K, L_{c}) \Rightarrow \;$ Cloth is made with [Capital]{.h} and [Labor employed in Cloth]{.h}
    - $Q_{f} = f(T, L_{f}) \Rightarrow \;$ Food is made with [Land]{.h} and [Labor employed in Food]{.h}
    - [Labor]{.h} across industries must sum up to total labor: $L = L_{c} + L_{f}$
:::

---

## Specific and Variable Factors

We call [Labor]{.h} our [variable factor]{.hp} because it is used in the production of both goods

And [Land and Capital]{.h} are [specific factors]{.hii} because they are exclusively used for specific goods

<br>

::: {.fragment}
With these modifications to the [HO Model]{.h}, we have now extended it into a [Specific Factors Model]{.hi-red}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
[Specific Factors]{.hii} are [immobile]{.hii}

- They cannot move between the two industries
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
[Variable Factors]{.hp} are [mobile]{.hp} 

- [Labor]{.h} can freely move across industries

## Trade Patterns

Trade flows will be determined similarly to our [HO Model]{.h}

The difference is that [Specific Factors]{.hii} will play a key role in determining [Comparative Advantages]{.hp}

Trade flows will be determined by the [relative endowment]{.h} of the [Specific Factors]{.hii}

---

## Trade Patterns 

Let's say that [Country A]{.hi-teal} is relatively well endowed with [land]{.h} and [Country B]{.hi-red} is relatively well endowed with [capital]{.h}

[Country A]{.hi-teal} will [Export]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
- [Food]{.hi}
::: 

[Country B]{.hi-red} will [Export]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
- [Cloth]{.hi}

## Specific Factors Dynamics

Let's look at the steps of openning to trade:

::: {.incremental}
- Each country opens up to trade 
- They each follow their [comparative advantage]{.hi-orange} and move toward greater specialization
- The [shift in production]{.h} reduces demand for the specific factor used in the non-specialized industry
    - In our example, the demand for [capital in Country A]{.hi-teal} goes down
- Income for the less utilized [specific factor]{.hii} also declines
:::

---

## Specific Factors Dynamics

This model helps us view [income distribution effects of trade]{.h} more clearly

::: {.fragment}
So we have [Country A capital owners]{.hi-teal} be hurt, due to the economy moving away from production of capital-intensive [cloth]{.h} 
:::

::: {.fragment}
On the other hand, we have [Country A landowners]{.hi-teal} experience the opposite effect
:::

:::: {.fragment}

## Specific Factors Dynamics

How about [Labor]{.h}?

::: {.fragment}
Because [labor]{.h} is mobile between industries, workers that are laid off in the declining sector will find employment in the expanding sector
:::

::: {.fragment}
Additionally, prices of both goods shift from what they were under [autarky]{.hii}

In [Country A]{.hi-teal} where [Food is the export]{.h}, we would see:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Price of Food]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Increase!]{.hi-green .align-center}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Price of Cloth]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Decrease!]{.hi-red .align-center}
:::

:::

::::
:::

::: {.notes}
Ask why $\rightarrow$ because world price for export is higher than at home and import is lower than at home

## Effects on Variable Factor Income

[The income distribution effect on the variable good is ambiguous]{.hp .align-center}

<br>

::: {.fragment}
- The net effect depends on which is strongest, rising Food prices or falling Cloth prices

- It also on their consumption patterns
:::

::: {.fragment}
In its most basic form, we have adapted the [HO Model]{.h} in such a way that we can observe income distribution effects:

- Across factor inputs that are specific to production ([Specific Factors]{.hii})

- Within factors used in both forms of production ([Variable Factors]{.hp})
