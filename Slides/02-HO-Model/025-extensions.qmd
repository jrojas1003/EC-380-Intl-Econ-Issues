## Empirical Tests

So far we have argued in-favor and against gains from trade exclusively from theory

You should always be skeptical and ask yourself two questions:

::: {.incremental}
- Do the predictions of generalized models hold in the real world?

- Are there other reasons that these predicted patterns may be observed in the data?
:::

::: {.fragment}
A great deal of work that economists do is translating theory into empirical analysis

For example, [Blonigen & Wilson (2008)]{.hp} examine whether port efficiency allows for greater volume of trade

## Emperical Tests - Comparative Advantage

All trade theories come down to differences between countries that establish [comparative advantages]{.hi-orange} which motivate trade

Each theory predicts which goods a country will import and export

<br>

::: {.fragment}
[Empirical tests are difficult due to our inability to observe an]{.h} ['autarky' counterfactual]{.hi-red} [and difficulty in]{.h} [measuring factor endowments]{.hi-red}
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Rather than going between extremes of no-trade to completely free trade, we normally imagine changes in [trade openness]{.hp} as a result of:

- Lower tariff rates and reduced trade quotas
:::

---

## Theory vs Empirics

[Ricardian Model]{.hp}

::: {.fragment}
- Challenging to test due to the assumption of relative differences in technology augmenting labor productivity

- Most countries do not produce goods for which they are at a comparative disadvantage so [there is no way to measure their productivity in those sectors]{.h}
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Findings]{.hp}

- As labor producitity in a particular industry rises, the intensive margin by which goods are exported increases. 
The country becomes a net exporter of that godo
:::

::: {.fragment}
[The Ricardian model]{.hp} has been more frequently and succesfully tested
:::

---

## Theory vs Empirics 

[HO Model]{.hp}

::: {.fragment}
- Even harder to apply tests due to challenges involved in accurately measuring factor endowments. 
Our measures of land and capital values are imprecise estimates
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Findings]{.hp}

- Cross-country measures of capital, land, and labor endowments are often measured using different means due to [methodological differences]{.h} across national accounting bodies

- Even with these flaws, the [HO Model]{.h} is a useful starting point through factor endowments which can then be supplmented with other ideas

- Useful way to categorize the income distribution effects of trade
:::

::: {.notes}
Other important determinants of trade such as economies of scale, corporate structure, and economic policy are not considered in the model

Findings: Housing's contributions to CPI is based on mortgage values in Europe while the US uses a rental-equivalence approach
:::

## Empirical Tests

So how do we address international economic theories when countries are all measuring our key statistics in different ways?

This normally requires an Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) or world body to apply data collection methods in a cross-country manner

<br>

::: {.fragment}
For example, I used data from [UN Comtrade]{.hp} which contained values of trade between countries at a detailed level

I complemented this with political manifesto data provided by the [Comparative Manifesto Project]{.hp} in order to document how increased opennes to trade has shifted political leans in Costa Rica
:::

## Empirical Tests

Other differences between countries, beyond technology and factor endowments, that partly explain difference in trade flows across countries are:

- Economies of Scale

- Corporate structures

- Economic policy

- Public infrastructure

- Institutional quality

---

## Extensions to Trade Theory

Because of these empirical concerns and other key country-level differences, further extensions to HO have been developed

<br>

- Product Cycle
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Trade vs FDI
- Offshoring & Outsorcing   
:::

::::

<br>

These provide theoretical settings which explain a portion of existing trade

---

## Extension - Gravity Model

This model says that to explain how a country trades with other countries, [we must factor in distance and size]{.h}

- The [larger]{.hp} the other country is, the more demand it represents on the global market for a given good

- The [closer]{.hp} the other country is, the cheaper it is to access that market

$$
    T_{ij} = \dfrac{GDP_{i}^{\alpha} * GDP_{j}^{\beta}}{D_{ij}^{\theta}}
$$

::: {.fragment}
Many empirical analyses leverage model specifications on these key factors, which explain much of the variation obseved in country-level trade flows    
:::

--- 

## Extension - Gravity Model

Some examples to fix ideas:

::: {.fragment}
- [Mexico's most important trade partner is the US]{.h}

    - Distance: Share a border which means transport costs are less than, let's say, Europe
    - Market Size: US market is huge, and will absorb a lot of Mexican output
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [US trade with Korea vs trade with Japan]{.h}

    - Distance: Relatively same distance which means equal-ish transport costs
    - Market Size: Japanese economy is larger which means more US goods enter Japan relative to Korea
:::

## Extension - Product Cycle

Explains exports of sophisticated manufactured goods from countries who are scarce in skilled labor and capital

Many manufactured goods go through product cycles where [factor inputs change over time]{.hp}

## Extension - Product Cycle

[Early/Development]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Goods are produced with a lot of testing (in inputs and final form)
    - Requires skilled labor to promote and develop product

- Consumers with higher incomes will be early-adopters and provide crucial feedback
:::

---

## Extension - Product Cycle

[Middle/Standardized]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Product becomes standardized in characteristics and production process
- Shift production toward low labor cost nations
:::

--- 

## Extension - Product Cycle

[Late]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Consumption in high-income countries exceeds production 
- Production is concentrated in low-income countries as production process has taken form of assembly-type operations
- High-income countries need to innovate and restart the cycle in order to continue growth

## Trade/FDI

In the [Product Cycle]{.hp} extension, firms invest abroad and some output generated is sent home for consumption

- This is a great difference from the [HO Model]{.hp} where no investment abroad is taken into consideration and factor endowments cannot cross countries

- We can then introduce the concept of [Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)]{.hp}

::: {.fragment}
[FDI]{.hp} suggests that cases may exist where firms elect to [invest abroad]{.hi-red} rather than transport/ship goods abroad
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Intrafirm trade]{.hp} is when these firms, with foreign affiliates, import outputs back home and it is handled by the parent firm
:::

---

## Extension - Offshore/Outsorce

[Offshoring:]{.hp} Set up a plant abroad to produce goods

[Outsorcing:]{.hp} Contract a different firm to produce goods for you. 
Can be international.

::: {.fragment}
Modernization of the trade process has made these [international features]{.hp} of production and distribution chains more feasible

::: {.incremental}
- Largely driven in the 1990s by internet availability, satellite communication, containerization of cargo and improved computing power

- Easier to succesfully manage business operations abroad (marginal cost of multinational enterprise operations lower)
:::

:::

---

## Extension - Offshore/Outsource

Effects include a trend toward international production, with comparative advantages across countries featuring in individual firms' supply chains

Rather than specialize in goods, countries can specialize in [key intermediate inputs]{.hi-red}

Trade economists refer to this as increased formations of [global value chains]{.hi-red}

Many exports and local production processes now rely on the availability of imports

::: {.fragment}
[There is a huge vulnerability if ports become congested or delays occur]{.hi-red}
