## Theoretical Outcomes of Assymetric Factors

The [Stolper-Samuelson Theorem]{.h} states that:

- Income depends on input supplied to the value of final product
- Wages will vary depending on their skill level
- Labor input earnings (wages) demand on their demand and supply

[Derived Demand:]{.hp}
Indirectly finding demand of an input used in produciton from the demand of the final good
:::

::: {.fragment}
If a good is in high demand, and therefore its price is high, then input factors receive high returns

## Changes in Prices & Effects on Income

Any change that impact prices will have direct impacts on outcomes
<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Open trade causes the [export good price]{.hi} to rise and [import good price]{.hi} to fall

- Demand for each input factor readjusts, which leads to changes in returns to each factor

- Resources [shift away from the imported good sector]{.hi-red} and [move toward the exported good sector]{.hi-green}, which cause changes in demand for each input

## Stolper-Samuelson Example

Let's consider an economy where the [sports cars are the export good]{.h}

These require a high amount of capital and low amount of labor inputs

::: {.fragment}
Because it is the [export good]{.h}, demand for [capital factors rise]{.hi-green} and demand for [labor factors fall]{.hi-red}
