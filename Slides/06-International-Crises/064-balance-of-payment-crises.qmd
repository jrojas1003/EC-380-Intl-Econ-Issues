## BoP Crises

[Defined as]{.hp} a country having a current account deficit that it cannot finance

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Deficit is financed through selling financial assets, which includes currency reserves, as a way to generate [capital account net inflow]{.hp} that offsets [current account net outflow]{.hp}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Foreign bankers extend loans, buy bonds, stocks or invest directly in deficit country's real estate market
- These flows must cover current account deficit

## BoP Crises

If the [deficit country]{.hp} capital investments/purchases appear too risky, capital inflows ease

As [Forbes and Warnock (2012)]{.hii} show, patterns have emerged of these flows acting as sudden stops and surges

::: {.incremental}
-  Can put great pressure on domestic reserve, causing them to dwindle

- The ability to [purchase goods abroad]{.h} using their denominated currency now faces a limit and may need to stop all together

- The ability to [convert local currency into foreign debt repayment transfers]{.h} also kicks in, causing further stress on the [deficit country]{.hp}
