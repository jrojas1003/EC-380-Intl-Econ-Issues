## Economic Trends

Manufacturing has been on a [long downward trend in NA and West EU]{.hp} for decades

Wage inequality increased, particularly in the US with a primary effect on young, low-education, and less-skilled workers

Throughout this period, [trade saw its greatest bout of liberalization]{.hp} due to:

::: {.incremental}
- Widespread tariff reductions
- Ascensions of major economies such as China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and;
- Reductions in direct trade costs (Advancement in technology)
:::

## Economic Trends

With the economy experiencing these long trends of declining manufacturing employment and wage reductions questions come up

::: {.fragment}
- Where are these jobs going?
- Are low wages abroad influencing wage levels in developed economies?
:::

::: {.fragment}
The [number of jobs]{.hp} depends on age profile, size of population, labor market policies, and the state of the business cycle

While trade does not act as the main influence of [jobs level]{.hp} for large open economies, it [might affect specific sectors]{.hi-red} in a particularly focused manner

## Trade & Employment

- Trade with less developed countries has potentially led to spillover effects on local wage rates

::: {.incremental}
- Up until recently, decline in low-skill wage rates was only somewhat attributed to increased trade openness

- It was initially suggested that [tech improvements were driving the marginal productivity of skilled labor upward]{.h}, driving up the wage gap

- Since 2000, this gap has stagnated, leaving experts without a main explanatory factor anymore

## Trade & Employment

Research in this area has seen a resurgence given that previously accepted reasoning on it has become outdated

A natural question that comes up is [whether trade or technology]{.hp} plays a larger role in sector-specific outcomes

::: {.fragment}
- I think this question is too broad and not entirely helpful to counteract the issue

- It may also redirect much needed attention from research that addresses how to [facilitate reallocation among displaced manufacturing workers]{.hp}

## Trade & Employment

Manufacturing firms that adopt specific technologies, such as computers or industrial automation, are [significantly different from those that do not]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
- They are larger and more productive upon adoption
:::

::: {.fragment}
While exposure to [greater import competition]{.h} is associated with employment decline, firms that increase their use of imported goods conditional on such exposure can exhibit employment gains

## Poverty and Inequality 

If there are documented negative effects, how about positives?

[Does International Trade Reduce Poverty & Income Inequality?]{.hp}

::: {.incremental}
- In 2013, China had 13.9% of the world's skilled labor and 39.8% of the world's less skilled labor
- For the same year, China held 16% of world GDP
- This makes them abundant in:
    - [Low-skilled labor]{.hp}
- And scarce in [High-skilled labor]{.h}
- Trade openness translates to elevated demand for low-skill workers, and their wages rise

## Poverty 

["Towards the End of Porverty" from The Economist]{.hp} has the following to say:

::: {.incremental}
- The number of people living off of $1.25 per day was cut by one-half over the past 20 years
- It has declined from 43% of the World Population in 1990 to 21% in 2010
- Attributes much of this achievement to China
:::

::: {.fragment}
> "China is responsible for three-quarters of the achievement... even though income equality is rising fast, extreme poverty is disappearing. China pulled 680m people out of misery in 1981-2010 and reduced its extreme poverty from 84% to 10%."
:::

## Inequality

While global poverty has fallen due to free trade, [what about income inequality?]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- Income inequality has been increasing
    - Higher incomes are rising more rapidly than lower incomes
- The same is true of the US $\Rightarrow$ The relative wages of skilled workers has been rising 
:::

::: {.fragment}
[This may seem counter-intuitive to what the HO model predicts]{.hp .align-center} 

A model of offshoring better explains this phenomenon but is beyond this course
