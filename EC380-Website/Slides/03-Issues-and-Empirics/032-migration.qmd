## Labor Supply

So far our models have kept labor supplies fixed across countries and not allowed for migration of labor between countries

Workers were able to switch sectors in [Ricardian]{.h}, [HO]{.h}, and [Specific Factors]{.h} models but not country

::: {.fragment}
If we were to incorporate this migration-feature into a model it may make it more realistic

## Cause of Migration

There are many possible and imaginable reasons individuals may migrate. We can categorize them into:

<br><br><br>

## Migration: Push Factors

These are things that may incentivize individuals to move [away from their origin country]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Local purchasing power being too low
- Housing too expensive
- Recessions
- Political strife/violence/uncertainty
- War & famine
:::

## Migration: Pull Factors

These are things that may [draw people into a receiving country]{.hi}

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Income levels
- Healthcare
- Socioeconomic stability
- Educational support/institutions
:::

---

## Migration: Social Networks

Not Facebook. But rather ["personal reasons"]{.hi} that may draw individuals and make them congregate in certain places:

<br><br>

::: {.incremental}
- Family ties
- Local affinities to surroundings
- Ethnic groupings/enclaves
- Insider opportunities

## Migration - Theory

[In theory]{.hp}, suppose we were in a scenario where trade was already open and now we wanted to allow for the free movement of labor

::: {.fragment}
[In theory]{.hp}, free movement of labor will see wages harmonize across countries as we saw them across industries in our simple models

It will do that to an extent, but [the gap between countries will still exist somewhat]{.h}
:::

::: {.fragment}
The European Union is a great real-world example of this process:

- Brexit placed a great deal of focus on [limiting the movement of people while trying to ekep the movement of goods open]{.h}
:::

---

## Migration - Practice

[In practice]{.hp}, empirics have shown [evidence of effects of low-skilled worker inflows]{.h} [not impacting]{.hi-red} [other local worker groups]{.h}

## Migration - Practice

## Migration - Practice

[In practice]{.hp}, high-skilled migrant influxes show a similar lack of impact

## Migration: Effects on Wages

We will keep it simple by assuming there are:

::: {.fragment}
- Two countries
- Produce a single good made with [labor]{.h} and an immobile factor
:::

::: {.fragment}
Since there is only one good, there is no reason to trade [however]{.hi} there will be "trade" in labor services

- Workers move in search of higher wages
:::

::: {.fragment}
In the absence of migration, wage differences across countries can be through technology differences, or differences in the availability of the immobile factor
:::

## Migration: Effects on Wages

![](images/krugman-migration-graph.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Horizontal axis is the total world labor force

MPL curves represent production of the same good in different countries

Wages are on the vertical axis and are "real wages" (wage divided by the price of the good in each country)
:::

## Migration: Effects on Wages

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
![](images/krugman-migration-graph.png){fig-align="left"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .small}
Home workers: $OL^{1}$  

Foreign workers: $L^{1}O^{*}$ 

Immobile Factor endowments are different and cause real wages to be higher in [Foreign (point B)]{.hi-orange} than in [Home (Point C)]{.hi-teal}

[Who moves where?]{.h .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Home workers]{.hi-teal} will migrate to [Foreign]{.hi-orange}

This reduces the [Home labor force]{.hi-teal} and raises the real wage in [Home]{.hi-teal}

In [Foreign]{.hi-orange} the opposite occurs

## Migration: Short-Run

Let's view a stylized example of how [migration may impact local labor markets]{.h} in the [Short-Run]{.hp}

Recall the [OH model]{.h}, where labor can move between industries but capital is fixed

We also have that labor is a sum of both industry labor, such that:

$$\bar{L} = L_{x} + L_{y}$$

## Migration: Short-Run

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/migration-short-run-02.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
[Effects]{.h .align-center}

::: {.incremental .small}
- Immigration causes total labor to change: $\bar{L}' = \bar{L} + \Delta L$
- Shifting out the supply curve of industry $x$ causes the corresponding marginal productivity curve to shift right by $\Delta L$
:::

:::

::::

## Migration: Short-Run

[Equilibrium Outcomes]{.hi} 

::: {.incremental}
- Number of workers in both industries rises
- Wages across both industries fall
- [Why?]{.hp}
    - Labor became [less scare/more abundant]{.h}, relative to the fixed amount of capital/land
:::

---

## Migration: Long-Run

In the [Long-Run]{.hi} other things are allowed to move which makes outcomes somewhat different:

::: {.incremental}
- Given a rise in labor ($\bar{L}$ to $\bar{L}'$ in our example), capital/land/labor ratios readjust
    - Immobile factors are free to shift in the [Long-Run]{.hi}
- Instead of what we see in the [Short-Run]{.hi}, these ratios adjust to ideal levels such that ideal production levels are maintained
- $\Delta L$ will flow entirely into the [labor-intensive]{.h} industry
