## PPP Example

Suppose a bag of goods costs [1000 USD]{.h} and [800 GBP]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
According to [PPP]{.hp}, the exchange rate is [$1.25 dollars to the pound]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Imagine that [GBP]{.hi}:[USD]{.h} is $2. 

Goods priced at [800 GBP]{.hi} in UK sell for [500 GBP]{.hi} if imported from the US and paid for in [USD]{.h} 
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[This presents an Arbitrage Opportunity]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Brits begin exchanging [GBP]{.hi} for [USD]{.h}, demand increases for [USD]{.h} [(Appreciation)]{.hp} until purchasing power parity is achieved

## PPP Example

A few unrealistic assumptions that we will have: consider these caveats

::: {.fragment}
- Assume that goods flow [without cost]{.hp} across international borders and that all goods and services can be traded
:::

::: {.fragment}
[In reality]{.h}, there are transportation costs involved with moving goods. 
Some goods and services are not traded
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Bank fees for a currency broker when buying the needed pounds
- Some of the goods and services are non-tradable, arbitrage is not possible
:::

::: {.fragment}
Also, few nations have eliminated all their [barriers to entry]{.hp} of foreign goods and services

## PPP in the Long-Run

<br>

Evidence shows that PPP exerts its influence over exchange rates [only in the long-run]{.hp} 

<br> 

Over time we have:

- Lower transport costs
- Minimized import rules 
- Minimzed regulations
