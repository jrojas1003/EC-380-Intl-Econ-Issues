## Production Possibilities Frontiers

The [Ricardian Model]{.h} assumed a single factor of production (labor) which was homogenous

- This implied that countries face the same trade-off between goods regardless of input levels

- The PPF was a straight line

. . .

The [HO Model]{.h} now considers [combinations of factors]{.h} where some specific mix of the two is most productive

- Because of this necessary mix of inputs, the [PPF will be a curve]{.hi-red}

## New PPF

## New PPF - Increase in Labor Intensive Good

## New PPF - Increase in Capital Intensive Good

## New PPF

Adjustments at the extremes of the frontiers require a [disproportionately large exchange]{.h} in factors

::: {.incremental}
- Each unit increase in one factor-good leads to an increasingly sizeable loss of the other factor-good
- [Opportunity costs]{.hi-orange} are [rising]{.hi-red} for each type of production 
- [Why?]{.hi-red}
:::

. . .

As you reallocate resources from a [capital-intensive good to a labor-intensive]{.hi}, you need greater amounts of factors due to factor combinations being misaligned

- AKA It is not a linear trade-off

## Autarky

country consumes exactly what it produces

## Free Trade - Gains from Trade

## Gains from Free Trade

Since we are trading at the [world price level]{.hi}, we can reach [higher]{.hi-green} indifference curves

- The country [produces at B]{.hi-red} and [consumes at C]{.hi-red} 

. . .

<br>
Therefore if the country produces more of the [capital-intensive product]{.hi} than they consume, [the must be exporting]{.h} a subset of that good

- That is the difference between [bundle B and bundle C]{.h}

. . .

In constrast, the country [produces less textiles than they consume]{.hi}, which suggests that they are [importing]{.h} the difference

---

## Comparing to the Ricardian Model

Try to remember why a country would shift their production when trading under a [different world price]{.hii}

. . .

The country [must produce where the]{.h} [opportunity cost]{.hi-orange} [is equal to the relative world price slope]{.h}

. . . 

The gains from trade are very similar between both models

Except that [the specialization in production is not complete]{.h}

- This is due to [diminishing marginal productivity]{.hp} associated with each factor

## Diminishing Marginal Productivity 

[Definition:]{.hp} 
Holding the other factor(s) fixed, the [marginal unit increase]{.h} of a given factor yields an increasingly smaller contributions to overall output

::: {.fragment}
Imagine having [one shovel]{.h} to share between [5 workers]{.h}.
The workers can take turns with the shovel whenever they get tired. 
But how much could [total work output]{.h} increase if we add [10 more workers]{.h}?

## Trade & Income Distribution 

In the [Ricardian Model]{.hi-red} we ruled out harmful effects and suggest everyone benefits in society.
Reallocated workers simply leave the shrinking industry for an expanding one. 

They are able to exchange their unchanged labor supply for a [larger bundle of goods]{.h}

- Specialization doesn't incur any costs/penalties

::: {.fragment}
The [HO Model]{.h} takes a more moderate view

Rather than [capital and labor]{.h}, let's consider two labor sectors:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Skilled
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Unskilled
:::

::::

:::

::: {.fragment}
Industries require different combinations of [skilled and unskilled]{.hi} labor

## Heterogenous Income Effects

We will go into this further later in the course but for now let's keep in mind that [trade openness can have heterogeneous effects]{.hi} depending on which part of the skill bracket the worker belongs to

<br>

::: {.fragment}
It can be shown that a systematic relationship exists between endowments of factors for a country and who ends up being winners and losers

<br>

I'll show you a [theoretical argument]{.hp} for how this can happen.
Later we will look at [empirical evidence]{.hp}, which uses applied econometric analysis.
