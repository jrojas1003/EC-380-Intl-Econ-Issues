## FX Market: Interest Parity

[Interest Parity Condition:]{.hp} 
Difference between the home and foreign interest rates should be equal to the expected change (appreciation or depreciation) of the exchange rate

<br>

::: {.fragment}
$$
    i - i^{*} = \dfrac{(F - R)}{R}
$$

- $i$ is the home interest rate
- $i^{*}$ is the foreign interest rate
- $F$ is the [expected future exchange rate]{.h}
- $R$ is the current exchange rate
:::

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

Suppose an investor has the choice to either [invest locally]{.h} or [invest abroad]{.hi} in one-year bonds

More generally:

> [X year bond:]{.h} 
After maturing for X years, the bond is paid back to the investor in full principal amount and includes a yield of interest accrued for X years

::: {.fragment}
A bond will have the payoff equal to:

$$
    P \times (1 + i)^{n}
$$

Where $P$ is the principal amount invested, $i$ is the interest rate, and $n$ are the years the bond accrues interest for before maturing

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

Suppose we are dealing with a 1-year [US]{.h} bond has a price of 1000 USD

The respective rates of return are $i = 0.03$ and $i^{*} = 0.02$.

Each payoff is in a different currency

Let's say we are considering a [US Bond]{.h} and a [German Bond]{.hi}

<br>

::: {.fragment}
$$
    \text{US bond} = 1000 \times (1.03)^{1} = 1030 \text{ USD}
$$

[The German Bond requires more careful thought]{.hp}

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

A [German Bond]{.hi} would be paid in [euros]{.hi}, so we have to consider exchange rates to compare them

::: {.incremental}
- Recall the [German Bond]{.hi} pays an interest equal to 0.02 (2%) [in euros]{.hi}

- The [dollar value]{.h} of this investment choice depends on the [future exchange rate one year from now]{.hp}

- Suppose the exchange rate today is [1.2 USD per EUR]{.h}

- Investor can buy [833.33 EUR]{.hi} in exchange for [1000 USD]{.h}
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    \text{EUR bond} = 833.33 \times (1.02)^{1} = 850 \text{ EUR}
$$
:::

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

To accurately compare the two choices, the investor must [forecast the exchange rate]{.hp} in one years time

- We denote this as $F$

::: {.incremental}
- If the [expected future exchange rate E(F)]{.hp} is $E(F) = 1.3 \text{ USD/EUR}$ 
- Implies an [expected foreign value]{.hp} of $850 \times 1.3 = 1105 \text{ USD}$
- The [US Bond]{.h} is worth $1030$, so the foreign return of $1105$ is more profitable
- The expected return of foreign investment is:

::: {.fragment}
$$
    i^{'} = \left[\dfrac{E(F)}{R} \times (1 + i^{*}) \right] - 1
$$
:::

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

To guarantee $E(F) = F$ is to [remove the uncertainty]{.hp} from the setting

::: {.fragment}
Hedge against exchange rate risk by signing contracts on the [forward exchange rate market]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Today's [spot rate]{.h} $R$ and market rate on one-year exchanges $F$ indicate where the market sees the Exchange Rate moving in one year
:::

::: {.incremental}
- If $F > R$, the currency is [expected to depreciate]{.hp}

- If $F < R$, the currency is [expected to appreciate]{.hp}
:::

## FX Market: Interest Parity Example

In our example, investors were willing to sell off [US Bonds]{.h} in order to purchase [German Bonds]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Funds will flow from the [US]{.h} to [Germany]{.hi}, causing [German Money Supply]{.hi} to increase
- A greater money supply implies lower interest rates, so $i^{*}$ falls
- Demand for [German Currency]{.hi} used to buy the bonds rises, so $R$ rises
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Market moves towards [interest rate parity]{.hp}

$$
    i - i^{*} = \dfrac{(F - R)}{R}
$$
:::

## FX Market: Interest Parity

What happens when $F$ changes?

::: {.fragment}
The future dollar value of [German Bonds]{.hi} in [USD]{.h} changes too

The scale and direction of the change dictate the choice investors make

Let's see what this might look like

<br>

::: {.fragment}
These mechanisms playout somewhat like a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.hp}

If investors think [USD]{.h} will depreciate in the future, $F$ rises

This causes return on foreign bonds to improve, causing demand on foreign currency to rise and the dollar's spot rate $R$ depreciates
